<p>Market Enginuity maximizes underwriting revenue for local public radio and television stations.  Publink is one of the products at Market Enginuity. Multunus was hired in Nov 2010 to build and launch version 2.0 of the the already existing product.</p>

<p>We inherited a legacy codebase, refactored some of the code, added new features, improved performance, moved deployment to Rackspace  and finally launched Version 2.0 in March 2010.</p>

<p>Since then the product has been in continuous development at Multunus. Many public radio stations currently use the Publink platform for their underwriting needs.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> This is a location aware service that enables Public Radio stations connect Local Businesses with the Local community. </p>

<p>The service exposes a REST based Web Service API which is consumed by both online Widgets [installed on public radio station web sites] and iPhone applications. This application is entirely built on Rails.</p>

<p><strong>Testing Frameworks:</strong> RSpec, Cucumber, Selenium</p>
