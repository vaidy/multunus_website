    <p>Janaki is our in-house analyst. She doubles up as our exploratory tester.</p><p>Where she’s added the most value so far, is in designing highly usable web interfaces – both for our product UserThoughts and also on multiple client projects. She spends considerable time researching UX related material. And then applies her knowledge to the designs that she creates.</p><p>Oh, almost forgot – she’s the company’s CFO. She’s is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and has an MBA in Finance. Our $$$ is in good hands, we think.</p><p>While we all enjoy working with her, its her food that gets us really excited. She’s an experimenter of sorts and thankfully, she’s been hitting the mark pretty well so far. </p>
