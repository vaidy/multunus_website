    <p>If you spot a tall guy leaning over and fiddling on our server, with his headphones on – that’s probably KP (or KrishnaPrasad, as he’s also known  .</p><p>KP brings to the table a high level of technical maturity – combined with the knowledge that technology is only useful if it actually solves a real problem. This makes him a valuable addition to the technology leadership team within the company.</p><p>As to why he prefers standing when there are chairs available, we’re not sure. We would ask him, if only he removed those headphones first </p>
