    <p>Its not often that you find folks using words such as “perfunctory” in their conversation. Anup happens to be one of those folks. And so, if the rest of this bio forces you to look up the dictionary, you can safely blame Anup – for having got us infected with his vocabulary.</p><p>Eclectically speaking, Anup interlaces exalted programming skills, a pleasant countenance (with plenty of flowing hair), an affirmative attitude, a high level of cognizance of the software industry along with ardor for his other “C” [Cricket]. The former “C” stands for “Coding”, of course.</p><p>Anup decided to leave behind superannuated technologies that originated in Seattle – to instead focus on something that has a lot in common with the number 37.</p>
