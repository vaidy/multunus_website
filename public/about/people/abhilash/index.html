    <p>Abhi is almost certainly one of the sharper folks we’ve seen in recent times. This fact, combined with the speed at which he devours information, inspires the rest of us to do better.</p><p>He’s as keen to learn about user experiences or the agile development process as perhaps the newest technology out there.</p><p>We’ve caught him off guard once or twice during our morning standups, but we love the way he smiles away these situations.</p>
