    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://www.multunus.com/blog/categories/continuous-delivery/">earlier posts</a> we've been doing Continuous Delivery for both Webapps and Android apps for quite sometime. This post is about setting up Continuous Delivery for iOS apps using Jenkins and <a href="http://testflightapp.com" target="_blank">TestFlightApp</a>. TestFlightApp is a free service which helps to do closed beta testing without putting into AppStore. Using their APIs, the process of delivering new versions of the app can be automated.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Setting up Continuous Delivery mainly involves the following steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Setup Mac Machine as Jenkins Node</li>
    <li>Setup Jenkins Xcode plugin</li>
    <li>Configure Distribution profile</li>
    <li>Integrate with TestFlightApp API</li>
</ul>


<p>Lets see those steps in detail.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Setup Mac Machine as Jenkins Node</span></strong></p>

<p>Setting up a node with Jenkins is very easy . You can either control the slave using SSH or using JWS. Each node will have a label name associated with it, which needs to be mentioned during setting up the job which needs to be run on this node. You can configure the nodes from the Manage Nodes under the Manage Jenkins option. The following screenshot shows how to configure a node using SSH.</p>

<p><img style="border: none;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/multunus-cdimages/jenkins_node.png" alt="Configure Node using SSH" width="579" height="411" /></p>

<p>This <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Step+by+step+guide+to+set+up+master+and+slave+machines">link</a> contains step by step instructions on how to configure a node using JavaWebStart.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Setup Jenkins Xcode plugin</span></strong></h3>


<p>Jenkins XCode plugin abstracts the xcode commands to run for creating packages for distribution. <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xcode+Plugin">Jenkins Wiki</a> has details about how to configure the same. I encountered one <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINQS-12635?focusedCommentId=161518#comment-161518">issue</a> while configuring the same, i.e. ipa generation was failing when the "Build output directory" was configured with relative path. It got resolved by giving the full path as <strong>${WORKSPACE}/build</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Configure Distribution profile</span></strong></h3>


<p>For distributing applications, an ad-hoc distribution profile needs to be created using the this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/provisioningprofiles/create.action?type=2">link</a>. The Development Provisioning Profile will not work with TestFlightApp. It took me sometime to figure out the same. The following video gives detailed instructions on how to create the same.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVO0tIHmQTg&amp;feature=relmfu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVO0tIHmQTg&amp;feature=relmfu</a></p>

<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integrate with TestFlightApp API</span></strong></h3>


<p>TestFlightApp provides <a href="https://testflightapp.com/api/doc/">API</a> which can be integrated with Jenkins to upload the IPA after successful build. I used curl command, as given as sample in the document, to upload the IPA. You can create support groups to be notified on each new upload of the app, and installation of the app is very simple i.e. just a click of link in the email. No iTunes and no sharing of IPA through emails.</p>

<p>One issue I was stuck during the setup was the configuration of the profile with the Xcode plugin. The plugin has the option "Embed Profile", but even if you give the path of the profile file, it was using the wrong profile for the IPA. The problem resolved when the profiles were refreshed in Xcode. You can get the Refresh option in the Organizer menu as shown below.
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/multunus-cdimages/refresh_profiles_xcode.jpg" alt="Refresh profiles - Xcode" width="600" style="border: none;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span></strong> This post is mainly about integrating Jenkins with TestflightApp, hence not talking about testing tools. I am planning to cover about the same in my upcoming posts.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to Continuous Delivery]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.multunus.com/2012/05/introduction-to-continuous-delivery/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-15T14:49:16+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://www.multunus.com/2012/05/introduction-to-continuous-delivery</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been doing Continuous Delivery for sometime and also been writing about how to implement the same. This post is about why Continuous Delivery is required and what problems does it solve.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Continuous Delivery</span></strong></h3>


<p>Continuous Delivery is the process of being able to continuously deliver new versions of a software product to create a tight feedback loop between users and the project team—including the customer or product owner.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This helps to test new ideas and changes in the product and also measure the effect of changes in the revenue. Continuous Delivery means releasing software very frequently, i.e. multiple times a day, rather than once in months.</p>

<h3><strong>Bottlenecks for Continuous Delivery</strong></h3>


<div>Lets see the usual challenges for releases. The following are the challenges that we faced before moving to Continuous Delivery. Let me put it in this way i.e. the following are the challenges which got us thinking on how to make releases more predictable and pain free. We already had a Continuous Integration setup at our end, but that was not enough to ease the process.</div>


<ul>
    <li>No tracking on which version was deployed, when and to which environment</li>
    <li>Different people working on different branches, code merge hell when its ready for deployment.</li>
    <li>When an urgent bug needs to be fixed, the fix need to be replicated in multiple branches along with the mainline branch</li>
    <li>No easy way to revert back to the previous stable version</li>
</ul>


<p>We've seen even more challenges in teams which do not have a Continuous Integration setup yet. They are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adhoc build processes</li>
    <li>Too much time spent on manual testing</li>
    <li>Integration of code happens only during deployment</li>
    <li>Complexity of build and deployment increases, depending on the complexity of the app.</li>
    <li>For clustered environments, the deployment needs to be updated to all slaves</li>
</ul>


<div>

Thats when we stumbled upon "<a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321601912&amp;WT.DCSext.w_ptgrevartcl=Continuous+Delivery%3a+Reliable+Software+Releases+through+Build%2c+Test%2c+and+Deployment+Automation_1641923_ISBNTopCover">Continuous Delivery</a>" book by Jez Humble and Dave Farley and extended our Continuous Integration setup to Continuous Delivery.

</div>


<div>
<h3>Continuous Delivery to the rescue</h3>
One of the key principle of Continuous Delivery is <strong>To </strong><strong>create a <em>repeatable</em> and <em>reliable</em> process for releasing software.</strong> It solves problems by providing fast automated feedback on the <strong>production readiness</strong> of the application - every time there is a change to the code, infrastructure or the configuration.  So in Continuous Delivery, <strong><em>Done </em>means <em>Released.</em></strong>

</div>


<div>A central pattern of Continuous Delivery is called the <em><strong>Deployment pipeline - </strong></em>an automated implementation of the application's build, deploy, test and release process. The following shows a sample deployment pipeline:</div>


<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: none;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/multunus-cdimages/pipeline.png" alt="Deployment Pipeline" width="549" height="189" /></p>




<div>The deployment pipeline includes the following build and deployment process:</div>


<ul>
    <li>Creates executable code to verify that the syntax of the source code is valid.</li>
    <li>Runs the unit tests to check that the code behaves as expected.</li>
    <li>Runs the acceptance tests to check that the application conforms to its business acceptance criteria—that it delivers the business value that was intended.</li>
    <li>Run nonfunctional tests which checks that the application performs sufficiently well in terms of capacity, availability, security, and so on to meet its users’ needs.</li>
    <li>Runs tools which check that the expected code quality criteria such as test coverage and other technology-specific metrics are met.</li>
    <li>Then in the manual testing environment, exploratory testing is done. In parallel a demonstration to the customer and a selection of users can also be done. This helps the product owner to decide whether there are missing features, or find bugs that require fixing.</li>
    <li>If any of the above fails, the deployment should be stopped because it is a clear indication that the application is not production ready.</li>
</ul>


<div>I will write about the Benefits of Continuous Delivery in the next post.</div>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Presentations [in Chronological Order]</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>DevOpsDays 2011: </strong>Leena gave a lightning talk on "Push Button Deployment with Jenkins". <a href="http://sliwww.slideshare.net/leenasn/push-button-deployment-using-jenkins">Here's the presentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>DroidCon India 2011: </strong>We gave two talks at this conference:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Leena and I co-presented on "Continuous Delivery for an Android application". Here's the <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/83-continuous-delivery-for-an-android-application">original proposal</a> and <a href="http://prezi.com/56ueprf0mkql/continuous-delivery-on-android/">here's the link to the prezi</a>. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=uNvjNIK1EEU">short video</a> where Leena and I describe the talk.</li>
    <li>Tamil and KP gave an intro to OpenGL on Android. Here's the <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/94-introduction-to-opengl-in-android">original proposal</a> and here's the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tamillarasan/introduction-to-openglinandroid?from=ss_embed">link to the presentation</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Agile India 2012</strong>: Leena and I spoke there on "Continuous Delivery for a Song". Here's the link to the <a href="http://submit2012india.agilealliance.org/node/8894">original proposal</a>. And here's the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/multunus.com/present/view?id=0AQj1177vtu0MZHRoM2dmN180NzRneGp2bXRndw">link to the presentation</a>. It was a live demo - and by the comments we got from our audience, we think it went off fairly well.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" title="Agile India 2012 Talk" src="http://www.multunus.com/images/DSC_7209-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" /></p>

<p><strong>Recent Writing: </strong>An article I wrote for YourStory.in was published late last year. It was titled "<a href="http://yourstory.in/2011/12/a-sneak-peek-into-mobile-app-opportunities-in-2012/">Mobile App Opportunities in 2012</a>".</p>

<p><strong>Blogging:</strong> Leena has written a lot of articles on Continuous Delivery <a href="http://www.multunus.com/blog/categories/continuous-delivery/">on this blog itself</a>. And Akshay <a href="http://akshayatmultunus.wordpress.com/">has been writing regularly</a> since he joined us last year.</p>

<p>I hope you found this round up useful. I expect the Agile India organizers to upload videos of the all the talks soon. Once that happens, I'll update this post with the link to the video of our talk there.</p>

<h2><strong>First let’s look at some <span style="color: #ff0000;">facts</span>:</strong></h2>


<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
    <li>About 40 per cent of Internet users in India <a href="http://www.medianama.com/2011/03/223-google-india-has-100m-internet-40m-mobile-internet-users-india-search-trends/">access it on their mobile phones</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2011/06/mobile-ize-your-business-with-google.html">61% users are unlikely</a> to return to a site that they found were not mobile optimized. What’s worse, 40% of them are likely to go to a competitor’s website.</li>
    <li>The middle class in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries together have the  <a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/79595/Kaboom-iOS-and-Android-International-Installed-Base-Expansion">largest untapped populations</a> that can now afford a smart phone but are yet to get one.</li>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>




<h2 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Now take a look at some major <span style="color: #ff0000;">trends</span>:</strong></h2>


<div style="font-weight: bold;">
<ul>
    <li><strong>More Platforms: </strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">We have Apple to thank - for creating the app economy with the iOS platform, Google for democratizing the smart phone with Android and<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/28/windows-phone-marketplace-hits-50-000-app-submission-milestone/"> now Microsoft</a> for making the life of the “I support all platforms” developer more difficult with Windows Phone 7. If you still want to include Blackberry, despite all of the<a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/pressure-mounts-on-blackberrys-rim/story-fnay3ubk-1226223581617"> recent gloom</a>, then that would make it 4 platforms that you’d at least want to consider.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>


<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">There are now more a million active apps now available across the major app stores. Apple’s app store and the Android Market currently lead by a large margin. However 2012 will probably bring in at least one more serious contender in the Windows Phone 7 marketplace - it has grown by more than 400% this year alone.</span></div>

<ul>
    <li><strong>"Hybrid" Cross Platform Apps: </strong>The cross platform tools I've referred to above, allow for native platform API [Application Programming Interface] calls as well.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr">An example of such an application is the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/the-onion-releases-free-html5-ipad-app/">Onion iPad</a> app. The application is written in HTML5 for the most part - but uses falls back on native API to play video. This is probably because of <a href="http://blog.millermedeiros.com/2011/03/html5-video-issues-on-the-ipad-and-how-to-solve-them/">some of the issues</a> related to HTML5 video tag support on iOS. The Onion plans to roll out the app quickly on the Android platform as well - and <a href="http://sndstl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/snd-app.pdf">with mostly the same code</a> [pdf].</p>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"><em>Main Challenges:</em></span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cross Platform Tools are not mature yet: </strong>The API documentation is sparse, support is patchy and the community is still nascent. So which platform should you bet on? Unfortunately, the answer is, "it depends" - on multiple factors such as whether you need a native look and feel (which Appcelerator and Rhodes provide - but PhoneGap does not), the number of platforms you need to support, the technical skills of your dev team etc.</li>
    <li><strong>The Mobile Web is Slow(er):</strong> Performance optimization is key if you want your site to look pretty and be snappy on mobile devices. There are<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=html5+performance+mobile"> many good resources</a> available to get you started in the right direction.</li>
</ul>

</span></div>
</div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low Cost Solutions for Mobile Optimization: </strong>While purely content based sites can choose to rely on the Mobile Optimization Services I've mentioned above, there are a lot of other verticals that don't have such an option - yet. For example, there are a lot of E-Commerce sites out there that are not mobile optimized. Especially those being run by small business owners or startups.</li>
</ul>
</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"><em>Main Challenges:</em></span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul>
    <li>The data has to kept in sync with the original systems - in a seamless fashion</li>
    <li>Mobile payment gateways are still far from mature - <a href="http://www.venturewoods.org/index.php/2011/01/19/mobile-payments-shifting-opportunities-for-startups/">especially in a country like India</a>.</li>
    <li>Oh, and the Mobile Web is Slow - but I said that already.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mobile presence for non-Internet-Savvy retailers: </strong>I'm going on a limb here - but most small retailers in India don't have an Internet presence - and what that means is, a certain  high quality trouser shop with very reasonable price tags - is now invisible on your phone.</li>
</ul>
</span></div>


<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> Main Challenge:</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>
<ul>
    <li>With even companies like Google<a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-20/internet/29679379_1_google-street-view-google-s-street-view-privacy-concerns"> facing stiff resistance</a> while trying to map our streets, you're left with the only other option - User Generated Content. And that in turn means, the classic chicken and egg conundrum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</span></div>


<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cross Platform Testing as Service: </strong>While there are cloud testing services now available for specific platforms, services that take care of automated cross-platform testing are still not available.</li>
</ul>
</span></div>


<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"><em> Main Challenge:</em></span></div>


<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul>
    <li>You've got SDK installations, developer &amp; signing certificates, build chains, and custom project layouts to worry about with each platform. <a href="http://savagelook.com/blog/portfolio/8-things-to-know-about-phonegap">PhoneGap solves this problem</a> for you from a deployment perspective, but running automated tests on multiple platforms is a different challenge.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"> </span></div>


<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">This list of opportunities is admittedly short. But I hope you are now motivated to brainstorm more ideas, distill the most interesting opportunities and finally implement a winner in 2012. Happy New Year! </span></div>

<img style="margin: 0px 12px;" src="http://www.multunus.com/images/tamil-and-kp.png" alt="" align="left" />This talk was on Second day of the Droidcon given by Tamil KP. The objective of talk was to have people get started with OpenGL programming which can seem to be a little heavy but it need not be. The talk started with a brief introduction to OpenGL and then had quick step-by-step tutorial demonstration. <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/94-introduction-to-opengl-in-android">More details here</a>.
