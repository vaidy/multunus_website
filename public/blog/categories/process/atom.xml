    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've been doing Continuous Delivery for sometime and also been writing about how to implement the same. This post is about why Continuous Delivery is required and what problems does it solve.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Continuous Delivery</span></strong></h3>


<p>Continuous Delivery is the process of being able to continuously deliver new versions of a software product to create a tight feedback loop between users and the project team—including the customer or product owner.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>This helps to test new ideas and changes in the product and also measure the effect of changes in the revenue. Continuous Delivery means releasing software very frequently, i.e. multiple times a day, rather than once in months.</p>

<h3><strong>Bottlenecks for Continuous Delivery</strong></h3>


<div>Lets see the usual challenges for releases. The following are the challenges that we faced before moving to Continuous Delivery. Let me put it in this way i.e. the following are the challenges which got us thinking on how to make releases more predictable and pain free. We already had a Continuous Integration setup at our end, but that was not enough to ease the process.</div>


<ul>
    <li>No tracking on which version was deployed, when and to which environment</li>
    <li>Different people working on different branches, code merge hell when its ready for deployment.</li>
    <li>When an urgent bug needs to be fixed, the fix need to be replicated in multiple branches along with the mainline branch</li>
    <li>No easy way to revert back to the previous stable version</li>
</ul>


<p>We've seen even more challenges in teams which do not have a Continuous Integration setup yet. They are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adhoc build processes</li>
    <li>Too much time spent on manual testing</li>
    <li>Integration of code happens only during deployment</li>
    <li>Complexity of build and deployment increases, depending on the complexity of the app.</li>
    <li>For clustered environments, the deployment needs to be updated to all slaves</li>
</ul>


<div>

Thats when we stumbled upon "<a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321601912&amp;WT.DCSext.w_ptgrevartcl=Continuous+Delivery%3a+Reliable+Software+Releases+through+Build%2c+Test%2c+and+Deployment+Automation_1641923_ISBNTopCover">Continuous Delivery</a>" book by Jez Humble and Dave Farley and extended our Continuous Integration setup to Continuous Delivery.

</div>


<div>
<h3>Continuous Delivery to the rescue</h3>
One of the key principle of Continuous Delivery is <strong>To </strong><strong>create a <em>repeatable</em> and <em>reliable</em> process for releasing software.</strong> It solves problems by providing fast automated feedback on the <strong>production readiness</strong> of the application - every time there is a change to the code, infrastructure or the configuration.  So in Continuous Delivery, <strong><em>Done </em>means <em>Released.</em></strong>

</div>


<div>A central pattern of Continuous Delivery is called the <em><strong>Deployment pipeline - </strong></em>an automated implementation of the application's build, deploy, test and release process. The following shows a sample deployment pipeline:</div>


<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: none;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/multunus-cdimages/pipeline.png" alt="Deployment Pipeline" width="549" height="189" /></p>




<div>The deployment pipeline includes the following build and deployment process:</div>


<ul>
    <li>Creates executable code to verify that the syntax of the source code is valid.</li>
    <li>Runs the unit tests to check that the code behaves as expected.</li>
    <li>Runs the acceptance tests to check that the application conforms to its business acceptance criteria—that it delivers the business value that was intended.</li>
    <li>Run nonfunctional tests which checks that the application performs sufficiently well in terms of capacity, availability, security, and so on to meet its users’ needs.</li>
    <li>Runs tools which check that the expected code quality criteria such as test coverage and other technology-specific metrics are met.</li>
    <li>Then in the manual testing environment, exploratory testing is done. In parallel a demonstration to the customer and a selection of users can also be done. This helps the product owner to decide whether there are missing features, or find bugs that require fixing.</li>
    <li>If any of the above fails, the deployment should be stopped because it is a clear indication that the application is not production ready.</li>
</ul>


<div>I will write about the Benefits of Continuous Delivery in the next post.</div>

    <link href="http://multunus.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/10/continuous-delivery-for-android-apps-part-2/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-06T06:51:57+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://multunus.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/10/continuous-delivery-for-android-apps-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post talks about how to run tests for the build setup as mentioned in <a href="http://multunus.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/09/continuous-delivery-for-android-apps-part-1/">Part 1</a>.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Generate the build script for test</span></h3>


<p>The suggested practice is to have 2 separate projects for android, one the source and the other for the tests. The following command will generate a build.xml for the test project. Replace the  with the path of the source path.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; line-height: 18px;">android update test-project -m ../&lt;project-path&gt; -p . </span></p>

<p>One problem I've seen is that, it does not break the build even if there are failures in the test. Issue is reported here:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=14241">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=14241</a></p>

<p>I had to override the run-tests target as mentioned below to fix this issue:</p>

<pre>&lt;target name="run-tests" depends="-install-tested-project, install"
description="Runs tests from the package defined in test.package property"&gt;
    &lt;echo&gt;Running tests ...&lt;/echo&gt;
    &lt;exec executable="${adb}" failonerror="true" outputproperty="tests.output"&gt;
        &lt;arg value="shell" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value="am" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value="instrument" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value="-w" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value="-e" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value="coverage" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value="@{emma.enabled}" /&gt;
        &lt;arg value="${manifest.package}/${test.runner}" /&gt;
    &lt;/exec&gt;
    &lt;echo message="${tests.output}"/&gt;
    &lt;fail message="Tests failed!!!"&gt;
        &lt;condition&gt;
            &lt;or&gt;
            &lt;contains string="${tests.output}" substring="Error" /&gt;
            &lt;contains string="${tests.output}" substring="Fail" /&gt;
            &lt;/or&gt;
        &lt;/condition&gt;
     &lt;/fail&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</pre>


<p>You can change the ant commands to <span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; line-height: 18px;">clean run-tests release </span>in Jenkins to run the tests as part of packaging.</p>

<p>Next I will be writing about how to start emulator from Jenkins while running the tests.</p>

<p>We constantly try to provide accurate estimates that we can defend with confidence. But there are situations where we end up making mistakes. And this post describes one such situation.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>One of our clients asked us to estimate a feature. As usual, we sent back an estimate without much delay.</p>

<p>After few days, our client asked us to implement this feature. When we started to think about implementing the feature we found that it would take at least double the time that we'd earlier estimated. We'd put ourselves in a bad situation. It would of course be very hard to convince the client as to why there was this much deviation - considering we discovered this even before actually starting to implement the feature. We did the 5 why's to get to the root of the problem.</p>

<p>We discovered the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We hadn't gone through the usual process of breaking down the feature to the desired level of granularity. Digging deeper, the following root causes emerged:
<ul>
    <li>The project had been on 'pause' mode for a couple of weeks and we had gotten busy with other things in the meanwhile.</li>
    <li>The value of the feature [to the end user] was not completely obvious to us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The solution? We've decided to ask ourselves the following question before sending across an estimate to any client in the future:</p>

<blockquote><em>Is this a <strong>confident estimate</strong>? Can we defend the estimate with proper reasoning?</em></blockquote>


<p>The above will force us to think again about the estimate and help us become more consistent.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Oh, and one more thing</span></strong>. Ask the stakeholder as to what value the feature is going to add - if it is not obvious. Don't assume that you're right!</p>

<p>If you're curious on what the client's reaction was, when we sent across the revised [and much larger] estimate, <strong>ask us in the comment below</strong> :) We'd love to hear from you!</p>

    <link href="http://multunus.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/09/continuous-delivery-for-android-apps-part-1/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-23T11:15:50+05:30</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>

We've set up our CI server for building android apps. We use Jenkins as our CI server, but the same steps can be applied to any CI server.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Setup Android Environment on CI server</span></h3>
You need to first install the android SDK and platform tools on the CI server. The steps are well defined <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html">here</a>. You can run the command <code>android update sdk --no-ui</code> if the CI server is in an headless environment.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Generate Build script</span></h3>
Using android SDK tool , you can generate build script for the android project which contains the standard steps for building the app such as clean, compile, release, install etc. The following command will generate the build script, replace &lt;appname&gt;, &lt;target&gt; and &lt;project path&gt; accordingly.
<pre>android update project -n &lt;appname&gt; -t &lt;target&gt; -p &lt;project directory&gt;</pre>
This will create build.xml file under the project directory. You need to create build.properties file with the following contents:
<pre>key.store=path-to-keystore
key.alias=[alias]
key.store.password=[pw]
key.alias.password=[pw2]</pre>
You can generate the key file using keytoool or you can generate the key file from eclipse. Run the command  <span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;line-height: 18px">ant clean release<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;line-height: 19px">, which will compile the files, and generate the apk files (it generates signed, unsigned and unaligned files). The signed version can be used for uploading to Android Market or for installing directly on any device. Couple of stuff to be noted here are:</span></span>
<ul>
    <li>Ant version has to be 1.8.0 or higher.</li>
    <li>Put the external libraries in the <span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;line-height: 18px">libs</span> directory. Build script automatically picks up the libraries put under libs directory, otherwise the script need to be changed to look at a different classpath.</li>
</ul>
Checkin the build.xml, build.properties and the key file into the repository.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Setup the CI server</span></h3>
The CI server has to run the ant script for building the app. One more setting what we've done in our Jenkins server was to archive the apks as artifacts (available in the post build action). In upcoming posts, I will cover how to do the following:
<ol>
    <li>Running android tests</li>
    <li>Running code/test coverage tools</li>
    <li>Actual deployment</li>
</ol>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Rebuilding in Jenkins]]></title>
    <link href="http://multunus.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/09/rebuilding-in-jenkins/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-22T14:32:49+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://multunus.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/09/rebuilding-in-jenkins</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div>

One option that might be required after setting up a <a href="http://multunus.herokuapp.com/blog/2011/07/continuous-delivery-using-jenkins-build-pipeline/">build pipeline</a> is the provision to redeploy an earlier version by click of a button. This can become handy when we find a bug in the production and want to see when the bug got introduced. For that we will have to redeploy the earlier version to the staging/UAT environment and test the same.

Jenkins by default does not allow to rerun any of the earlier jobs. But you can achieve this by the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Rebuild+Plugin">Rebuild</a> plugin. It allows you to rebuild any job provided its parameterized build. It also allows you override the parameters. It will show the "Rebuild" button at the left side as shown below when you go to a specific build page:

<img src="http://multunus.herokuapp.com/images/rebuild.png" alt="" width="156" height="247" />

This is not a replacement for revert build, because it does not take care of reverting DB. But this can be extended to do the same.

Note: It will show the Rebuild button only for those builds which occurred after installing the plugin. I took some time to realize this and it is not very clear in the documentation.
