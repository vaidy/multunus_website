Don’t rely on him to pick a fight – he won’t give you a chance. Ask him for his opinion on anything however, and you can rest assured that he’ll think about it deeply before responding.

Not too many people straight out of college have the maturity that Ernest brings to the table. He joined us with no prior experience but was able to whiz through our training program and start adding value soon after.
Ernest is one of those folks who takes everything is his stride. The occasional long day at work, odd tasks, following instructions to the ‘T’ when the need arises – he’ll do all these and more with a smile. His technical skills include Ruby on Rails, JQuery and some dabbling on the Android platform.

Finally, his love for good humor shows up in his spontaneous laughter every now and then.
