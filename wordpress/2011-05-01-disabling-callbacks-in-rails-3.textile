title: Disabling callbacks in Rails 3
---

It is common requirement to disable the callbacks like @after_save@, @after_create @etc while importing/migrating data. One way to avoid this is by directly importing the data into DB using a command like @mysqlimport@. But by doing that, the Rails validations etc will not work. We can disable the callbacks using the @skip_callback@ method.  For eg:

@User.skip_callback("create",:after,:send_confirmation_email)@

The above will skip the @send_confirmation_email@ callback fired on after_create.

To set the callback back:

@User.set_callback("create",:after,:send_confirmation_email)@
