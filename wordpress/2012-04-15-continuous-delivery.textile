title: Continuous Delivery
---

Keeping a lot of software inventory is not a good idea. The longer the code remains outside of production, the greater the chance that it will become irrelevant, sooner than later.

Software is only useful when it is in the hands of the user. It therefore beckons us to do everything we can to deliver software as frequently as possible to the end user. And by frequent, we mean at least once a week - and ideally _more than once a day_.

At Multunus, we've following the above model of software delivery since mid-2011. While this model of delivery is suggested for almost any type of project, it is mandatory for *Lean Startups*.

Besides automated testing and continuous integration, setting up a CD system also involves setting up the following:**
**
<ul>
	<li>A Build Pipeline</li>
	<li>A Push Button [or one-click] Deployment system</li>
	<li>A Configuration Management system</li>
</ul>
Take a look at the following video [< 2 min] to get a bird's overview of the CD system that we've setup at Multunus. _Apologies for the poor quality of the video._

Beyond the above, implementing a CD system requires the following skills:
<ul>
	<li>Feature Toggling</li>
	<li>Plan and delivering features in small increments</li>
	<li>Identifying and automating anything and everything that is repetitive</li>
</ul>
We've written and spoken about CD a fair bit since late 2011:

*Continuous Delivery Blog Post Series: *We've written a lot of posts on CD. You can <a href="http://multunus.com/category/all/continuous-delivery/">find them all here</a>. If you don't know where to start, you can start by <a href="http://multunus.com/2012/05/introduction-to-continuous-delivery/">reading this post</a>.

*DroidCon India 2011:  *The topic was “Continuous Delivery for an Android application”. Here’s the <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/83-continuous-delivery-for-an-android-application">original proposal</a> and <a href="http://prezi.com/56ueprf0mkql/continuous-delivery-on-android/">here’s the link to the prezi</a>. The following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=uNvjNIK1EEU">short video</a> is a preview we recorded before the talk:

*Agile India 2012*: We spoke there on “Continuous Delivery for a Song”. Here’s the link to the <a href="http://submit2012india.agilealliance.org/node/8894">original proposal</a>. And here’s the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/multunus.com/present/view?id=0AQj1177vtu0MZHRoM2dmN180NzRneGp2bXRndw">link to the presentation</a>. It was a live demo – and by the comments we got from our audience, we think it went off fairly well.
