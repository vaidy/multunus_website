We have been seeing a lot of traffic to the website lately: developers, visitors from RubyConf, potential clients (we hope!) and the occasional drifter.

We thought this was the perfect opportunity to put our subscription of SnapEngage to good use. SpanEngage is a great tool to connect directly with website visitors. It highly configurable and if you pay more you can customize it as well.

The 'official' chat agents (who website visitors talk to) at Multunus also double up as developers, leads and the CEO. So, website visitors would ping one of us, and we'd be not be available to respond to them. The reason is that SnapEngage does not differentiate between 'idle' and 'online' status of a chat agent and pings them regardless.Â  This leaves the visitor with a bad experience.

We have now switched to pidgin which allows us to change status to offline when idle. This is specially useful for SpanEngage proactive chat.
