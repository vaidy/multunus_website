This is a SaaS application. <a href="http://www.calendarcruncher.com/tour">Multiple videos here</a>

**Challenges faced:**
<ul class="list_near_image">
	<li>The calendaring domain is quite mature – there are multiple standards [CalDAV, iCal - including a section for Recurring Events] and many implementations. To make things more complicated, each implementation differs from others in one way or another. CalendarCruncher masks these differences and creates a seamless experience for the user.</li>
	<li>The UI had to be almost completely Javascript driven – to create a user experience that is very similar to that of a native client such as Microsoft Outlook.</li>
	<li>The application allows the user to sync with Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook and Apple iCal – all from the same interface. Further the user is also allowed to change the external calendar they’ve synced their local calendar with – from say iCal to GCal. These features required us to build a platform that could talk to various calendaring systems using a common interface.</li>

	<li>One component that we did not have suitable open source options for – was the Outlook plugin that had to be shipped with CalendarCruncher. So we built the plugin from scratch using C#. This is full fledged client that does bi-directional syncing of your Outlook calendar with that in CalendarCruncher – using the CalDAV protocol.</li>
