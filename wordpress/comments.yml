content: These 4 bullet points explain a lot. Each of them can be expanded to a book
  to publish. When the world was struggling to survive, a new organization has been
  formed and with such a short time brought to an excellent stage. Really remarkable.
  Hats off to the leaders and master minds.

content: Thank you for your comment, Saurabh. <br><br>As regards your question on
  Wordpress, I&#39;m curious as to how you got the impression that we&#39;re biased
  towards any platform. Yes, we like Java and Ruby more - because they&#39;re better
  languages to code in. <br><br>But we try and use tools which serve our objectives
  better. Wordpress, is I believe, a very good example of a highly usable product.
  And to that end, it has served us very well. In addition, there&#39;s also a great
  community out there that supports it.<br><br>We bought our theme from WooThemes
  and are quite happy with the overall look and feel our site. And we&#39;ve received
  positive feedback to that effect as well.<br><br>If we&#39;re able to build something
  like this in a few weeks from scratch to completion using Wordpress with just one
  developer, without involving a professional designer, its obviously a good bet.<br><br>As
  regards UserThoughts, I&#39;m sorry you got the error. Can you please write to "support@userthoughts.com"
  with details, so we can help you out? Thank you.

content: ! 'Thanks, Chirag. Answers to your questions:

  <br>

  <br>* Why do you call it Software as a balance ? Are you pointing to specific

  <br>trade-offs ?

  <br>- Many of the projects that we work on are "green" - i.e. [coding from

  <br>scratch]

  <br>- The idea is to ship these as a "complete" product as soon as possible

  <br>[typically in less than a couple of months] - and then open the doors for

  <br>learning from the user community as to what works and what doesn&#39;t

  <br>- So, one of the "balances" we try and do is to build as many features in

  <br>limited time to differentiate ourselves from the competition - but at the

  <br>same time try and keep the code "sufficiently" clean to allow for easy

  <br>maintenance and extensibility

  <br>

  <br>This kind of thing of course applies to many [if not all] of the of the

  <br>aspects mentioned in the circle above. Conscious trade-offs - keeping the

  <br>constraints in mind - are I think key to to success on almost any project,

  <br>especially when resources are scarce.

  <br>

  <br>* Isnt there too much overlap between good design and constant UX focus. If

  <br>you focus on great design you get good UX and vice versa.

  <br>You&#39;re right here and I felt that too, actually. The reason I felt it made

  <br>sense to still separate it out, is because all too often, real "User

  <br>Testing" is done as an afterthought [or not at all!]. Perhaps it needs to be

  <br>renamed as "Real User Testing". Would that make it more clear?'

content: Hi Anitha<br>As per the discussion of you with James i want to conclude with
  that in your development process proper timeline for reviews, re-reviews, Risk estimation(under
  risk Management) ,scheduling of various tickets or tasks and spent some piece of
  time in others shoes of gossips...are required tremendously and i believe in future
  the "Crunch mode" issues will left out from your and your guys life.....<br><br>Regards<br>Saurabh

content: This is a honest post and a<br>      great one. I was curious to understand
  what you meant by "the lack<br>      of appreciation" problem.

content: ! 'Hi Pradeep,<br>Thank you very much for reading my post.<br>By "Appreciation"
  what I meant to say was that we perhaps took the process for granted - in that we
   gave ourselves and the technology more credit - rather to the process itself. The
  team and the technology are important, for sure - but of equal importance [or should
  I say, "more important"] is the process itself.<br><br>A relevant quote from James
  Shore&#39;s book itself [Chapter 4: Adopting XP, page 49]:<br>To understand and
  appreciate XP&#39;s technical practices fully, you need to experience the practices
  meshing together to give you complete confidence in your code, tests and build.
  You need to feel the delight of making big improvements with small changes.'

content: I am glad you made made the mistake of not giving much credit to the process
  because if the process deserves any credit it is because of people making it to
  suit to the context and that&#39;s what you appear to be heading towards. Its still
  fair, in my opinion.<br><br>Now, why I say that? Larger your organization gets,
  slowly the appreciation shifts completely to the process. I see many big organizations
  fail but I think you are talking about team level team specific practices and in
  that case, it makes sense.<br><br>BTW, &lt;&lt; We have been following almost everything
  mentioned in your book “The Art of Agile Development”. &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t agree
  to this part. Trying to follow everything in no matter what good book might not
  be a good practice. I wish you explain that part in more detail. <br><br>I am not
  saying, "you shouldn&#39;t" but here is how you should have said, "We analyzed our
  context and found factors 1, 2, 3 and 4 suiting to what James Shore suggested in
  his book and we tried that. Here are our results".

content: Hi Pradeep,<br>&gt;&gt;"Following everything from a book might not be a good
  practice"<br>While I agree that the above is the correct approach for many "how-to"
  books out there, I&#39;m pretty certain that the Art of Agile Development is an
  exception to this rule. After a couple of us had read the complete book, we felt
  that the quickest way we could extract value out of the book would be for us to
  stick to everything written in there as much as possible. Based on the experience
  we had with earlier projects, we somehow intuitively felt that "every single" practice
  described in the book would help us in one way or another. Hence we made a conscious
  decision early on to follow things in the book to "T". In hindsight this was a good
  decision that we made - because over the last 4 months, we&#39;ve realized that
  our earlier hunch was correct - and it is indeed true that every page in the book
  is worth understanding and practicing. Having said the above though, the book itself
  has a last section that encourages the reader to go beyond and experiment with new
  practices or modified version of the existing practices. And to circle back to your
  comment once again, we should have probably done that during the crunch mode. :)
  But then again, we&#39;re back to square one, which is that, for us to get to that
  point, we&#39;d first need to appreciate the entire process as a whole - instead
  of as a set of practices.

  how their commitment to the process has made improvements to their work. I had asked
  Rema and Tamil (a comrade at Multunus) about it. They had both the told the same
  thing. But the stand-ups still didn&#8217;t make much sense to me. At one point,
