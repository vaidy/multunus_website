<ul class="list_near_image">
	<li>Detect whether the phone is in free fall or not [such as sliding down a slope, for example]</li>
	<li>Display the metrics of the fall â€“ the height of the fall, the speed at impact and the number of second the phone was in the air.</li>
</ul>
**Technical Details**
The accelerometer can detect the acceleration of the phone along the 3 coordinate axes (relative to the phone). In this app, this sensor is constantly monitored for abrupt changes in acceleration.
The values for a free fall is typically different from a controlled or a forced fall ( a free falling body accelerates with 1 G or 9.8 m/s2 towards the ground). This can be used to differentiate between the different types of fall.
