We achieved the following on this project:

<ul class="list_near_image">
	<li>Transitioned the product from an older version and then revamped almost the entire site</li>
	<li>Built an easy-to-use online interface that allows users to upload pictures in a variety of different ways â€“ including group pictures</li>
	<li>Interfaced with an online external picture matching service, to allow users to easily and quickly find their matches</li>
	<li>Loaded a large number of celebrity pictures from external databases and got them indexed by the external service</li>
	<li>And, last but definitely not the least, made the entire user experience highly interactive and fun</li>
</ul>

**Technologies Used:** Ruby on Rails, Prototype JS
