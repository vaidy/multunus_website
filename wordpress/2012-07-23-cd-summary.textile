title: Continuous Delivery - Summary
---

At Multunus, weâ€™ve been practicing Continuous Delivery (CD) since mid-2011. We've invested significantly in our software delivery infrastructure and we're proud to let you know that it is an advanced setup. For example, we have setup a completely automated one-click push button deployment system to push software to staging and production.

" The essence of my philosophy to software delivery is to build software so that it is always in a state where it could be put into production. We call this Continuous Delivery because we are continuously running a deployment pipeline that tests if this software is in a state to be delivered. "
