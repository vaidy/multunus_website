p. *Architecture:* The web service API's had to consumed from both desktops and tablets - starting with Android tablets. We suggested that we use HTML5 - and then go live on the desktop first. And that we wait for Android tablets to catch up on their support. Our bets seem to have played out quite well - since Chrome Beta is already functional on the Android.

p. *Technologies:* The desktop clients is powered by HTML5, Backbone.js and CSS3.

p. *Testing Frameworks:* Jasmine, JSTestDriver and Sinon.js on the front end.
