So we’ll use bullets instead to convey our message:
<ul class=""list_near_image"">
	<li>Super frequent (and consistent!) blogger [Check out <a href="http://akshayatmultunus.wordpress.com/">akshayatmultunus.wordpress.com</a>]</li>
	<li>Customer Service Fanatic</li>
	<li>He’ll be known as the one who turned down a “safe” and cosy job at a large company – just to work with us</li>
	<li>Super fun to be with</li>
	<li>Part of the Multunus Campus Interview team</li>
</ul>
If the above list seems long to you, here’s two more things to keep in mind about him:
<ul>
	<li>His dedication is unparalleled. We are ready to place a bet that you will not be able to find someone who’s more dedicated than Akshay.</li>
	<li>If you wanted to understand what a passionate programmer is all about, your can either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development-Pragmatic/dp/1934356344">read the book</a> or just meet Akshay in person.</li>
</ul>
