Anup happens to be one of those folks. And so, if the rest of this bio forces you to look up the dictionary, you can safely blame Anup – for having got us infected with his vocabulary.

Eclectically speaking, Anup interlaces exalted programming skills, a pleasant countenance (with plenty of flowing hair), an affirmative attitude, a high level of cognizance of the software industry along with ardor for his other “C” [Cricket]. The former “C” stands for “Coding”, of course.

Anup decided to leave behind superannuated technologies that originated in Seattle – to instead focus on something that has a lot in common with the number 37.
