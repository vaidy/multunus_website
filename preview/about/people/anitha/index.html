    <p>An epitome of focussed attention, Anitha reminds us that it is indeed possible to get a lot done in an 8 hour day. Her passion for Agile Testing helps us to propagate Agile values throughout the organization.</p><p>She has a strict schedule. This means the rest of us have to scamper to deliver releases on time for her to test.</p><p>She’s also a quiet person. But this also means she can quietly eat your lunch – unless you’re careful. No pun intended, it’s happened already</p>
