Multunus started its operations from scratch in April ‘08. Our goal was to build a top quality, high integrity, customer focused and a very employee friendly organization. Our progress since then:



	
  * The team has grown to 18 full time people. We expect to reach 25 by March 2013.

	
  * Built more than 10 products for clients across multiple domains.

	
  * Conceived and built our own first product – UserThoughts [Currently in Alpha].

	
  * Transformed our entire process to upgrade to Extreme Programming across all projects.

	
  * Silver Sponsored RubyConfIndia 2011.


It is the following things that have really helped us get to where we are today:

	
  * We have some of the most committed and passionate individuals on our team.

	
  * A very strong faith in our ability as a team to deliver real value for our customers.

	
  * A strong focus on continuous improvement – both in terms of our knowledge and our skills

	
  * The fact that we really enjoy what we do here at Multunus


We’re now at a point of inflection that will allow us to tap into our potential and deliver a lot more value in 2012.
