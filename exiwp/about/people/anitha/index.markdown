[![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/anitha-300x249.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/anitha.jpg)An epitome of focussed attention, Anitha reminds us that it is indeed possible to get a lot done in an 8 hour day. Her passion for Agile Testing helps us to propagate Agile values throughout the organization.

She has a strict schedule. This means the rest of us have to scamper to deliver releases on time for her to test.

She’s also a quiet person. But this also means she can quietly eat your lunch – unless you’re careful. No pun intended, it’s happened already
