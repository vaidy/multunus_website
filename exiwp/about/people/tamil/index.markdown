[![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tamillarasan-300x231.jpg)](/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tamillarasan.jpg)It took just about 4 weeks for Tamil to convert the rest of us from his trainers to his trainees. The first couple of weeks, he remained silent listening to everything we were “teaching” him. It was probably then that he felt that enough time was wasted and decided to get into the drivers seat himself.

The above is perhaps coincident with the fact that he was a visiting computer science lecturer – while still in college 

Tamil joining our team, is proof that we’re effectively avoiding the [Bozo Explosion](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/how_to_prevent_.html). He’s our official “Young Resident Genius”.
