![Humshakal](http://new.multunus.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/consumer/104__320x240_humshakal.png)Humshakal.com is a social networking application based on the idea that people who look like each other are going to want to connect with each other as well.

We achieved the following on this project:




	
  * Transitioned the product from an older version and then revamped almost the entire site

	
  * Built an easy-to-use online interface that allows users to upload pictures in a variety of different ways â€“ including group pictures

	
  * Interfaced with an online external picture matching service, to allow users to easily and quickly find their matches

	
  * Loaded a large number of celebrity pictures from external databases and got them indexed by the external service

	
  * And, last but definitely not the least, made the entire user experience highly interactive and fun



**Technologies Used:** Ruby on Rails, Prototype JS
