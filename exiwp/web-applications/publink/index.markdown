![Publink](http://new.multunus.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/local/157__320x240_publink.png)**Publink.com:** This is a location aware service that enables Public Radio stations connect Local Businesses with the Local community.

It was our job to upgrade the system from Version 1 to Version 2 – along with the migration of the already signed up radio stations to the new version. Further, we’re also responsible for adding new customers to the new version.

Many of the Extreme Programming practices were applied on this project – including Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Exploratory Testing.

**Technologies Used:** Ruby on Rails, Cucumber, RSpec, Selenium
