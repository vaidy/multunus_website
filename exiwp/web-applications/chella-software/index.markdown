![Chellasoft](http://new.multunus.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/finance/101__320x240_chellasoft.png)ChellaSoft hired us to build an online front end for their stock trading system. The solution had to be state-of-the-art, which in this case, meant a desktop-like user experience.

A combination of streaming quotes and the ability to notify the user proactively about events at the stock exchange, meant that we’d have to rely on a Comet [HTTP Push] based technology.

Further, the backend system was developed in .Net. But with the latest Comet innovation happening in the non-Microsoft world, we came up with a front-end solution that was Java based. This helped keep the total cost of ownership [TCO] low, but also meant that a Java-.Net interface had to be written.

This was a project that had a lot of moving parts. And getting it working smoothly across all of its myriad layers, is one of the achievements that we’re quite proud of, at Multunus.

**Technologies Used:** SmartGWT, LightStreamer [Comet Server], JNBridge
