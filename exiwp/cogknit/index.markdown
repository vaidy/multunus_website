CogKnit is a Semantic Web company based out of Bangalore. Their first product is in the education space and is called Nimit. Multunus was hired to build a front end to consume the web service API's exposed by the back end.





CogKnit won anÂ [award for the most innovative product](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FCogKnitAward&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHht7QI9MRLhxyRpO_q-aZHNhfrxw) - at the World Education Congress (International Event attended by people from more than 88 countries) that happened in Mumbai on June 29-30, 2012.


  



**Architecture:** The web service API's had to consumed from both desktops and tablets - starting with Android tablets. We suggested that we use HTML5 - and then go live on the desktop first. And that we wait for Android tablets to catch up on their support. Our bets seem to have played out quite well - since Chrome Beta is already functional on the Android.


  



**Technologies:** The desktop clients is powered by HTML5, Backbone.js and CSS3.


  



**Testing Frameworks:** Jasmine, JSTestDriver and Sinon.js on the front end.
