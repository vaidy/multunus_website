**Technology Summary**




We prefer using Ruby on Rails on the server side, but have done quite a bit of work on Java as well. We complement this with HTML5/CSS3, JQuery and Backbone.js on the client side.




On the mobile front, we build “purely” native iOS and Android applications. And cross-platform mobile applications using PhoneGap.




Finally, all of our code is test driven. Yes, that includes Javascript, iOS and Android native code too.

## Technologies




#### Ruby on Rails with JQuery


We’ve been working with RoR from 2008. During this time, we’ve had the benefit of working with and seeing Rails evolve from version [2.x.x] to version[3.x.x]. We’ve also worked with **JRuby** extensively. **Our Testing Stack:**While we’ve done a fair bit of work using Cucumber, we prefer just sticking to RSpec for the most part. This combined with performance enhancement tools such as Spork - is now our bread and butter. For Javascript code, we write tests using Jasmine. And we use JSTestdriver to ensure they’re cross-browser platform compliant. Here’s a sample of the applications that we’ve built on RoR:



	
  * [CalendarCruncher.com](?page_id=231): An Online Calendaring Application that supports Bi-Directional Sync across multiple clients.

	
  * [Publink](?page_id=243): A Location Aware platform

	
  * [ElixirHealth.com](?page_id=237): A web application [with a Refinery CMS backend] that focuses on the "wellness", "consumer"and "e-commerce" aspects of the Health vertical.




#### Spring and Hibernate


Our experience with Spring and Hibernate goes back to 2002. And during this time, our team has built almost a dozen products on this framework. More recently we’ve worked with the augmented stack which includes tools such as Spring ROO. Our testing stack: Junit Here’s a sample of the applications that we’ve built with the above stack:




	
    * An ETL [Extract, Transform, Load] system that processes a database of 200+ Million records containing financial data of companies across the world.

	
    * An online social shopping platform that aggregates data across hundreds of online retailers in the US.
