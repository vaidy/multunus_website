Narrable is a new kind of storytelling website that transforms your photos and videos into powerful stories that are rich in context and perspective. It allows you to create stories about your most important memories and share them with those around you. The site is currently in closed Beta.
  




  

Narrable is an angel funded Lean Startup based out of Oklahoma. Here's a link to a [recent article that appeared](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tulsapeople.com%2FTulsa-People%2FJuly-2012%2FTech-savvy%2Findex.php%3Fcparticle%3D4%26siarticle%3D3%23artanc&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHXcourV7JnX71BS4lUSu8YoQYDpQ) in one of the local Oklahoma newspapers.
  

**Technologies:** The product has a REST API on the server side - built using Rails 3.2. The desktop client is powered by HTML5 and Backbone.js - whereas the iPad app has been built using PhoneGap. 
  

**Testing Frameworks:** Jasmine, JSTestDriver and Sinon.js on the front end. RSpec at the backend.
  

**Continuous Deployment Tools:** Jenkins CI, Jenkins Build Pipeline, Capistrano and Moonshine for the desktop. TestFlightApp [for auto deployment on the iPad] and the Jenkins XCode Plugin are also being used for the iPad app.
