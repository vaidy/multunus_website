According to the book [Continuous Delivery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912?tag=contindelive-20), the database also should be under version control, and Rails allows us to achieve this with ActiveRecord Migrations. Even though [Capistrano](http://www.capify.org/) can run the migrations automatically with its `deploy` command, its `deploy:rollback` task does not rollback the DB migrations automatically.  I've created a small capistrano [recipe](https://github.com/multunus/capistrano-db-rollback) which can take care of rolling back migrations.  The assumptions made are:



	
  * All the migrations have the `down` method defined properly. You can check for this by running `rake db:migrate:redo`

	
  * The schema.rb exists in the repository. This is one of the [suggested practices](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html#schema-dumps-and-source-control) for Rails.


The script is very simple, it extracts the version from the `schema.rb` and runs the `rake db:migrate` with the same version. The task gets run automatically along with `deploy:rollback`. This approach should work for most small and medium complexity Rails apps.
