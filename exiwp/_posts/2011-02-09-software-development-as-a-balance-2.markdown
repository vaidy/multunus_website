Why is delivering good software on a consistent basis hard? There are many existing answers to this question already. This is our version.

A list of things good software should achieve:



	
  * Should solve a real problem

	
  * Should be shipped and maintained within the budgeted cost and time

	
  * Should be easy to use


**Update: **We've now migrated to [James Shore's definition](http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/why_agile.html):


_"Success is usually defined as delivering on time, under budget, and as specified. That's a flawed definition. Many late projects are huge successes for their organizations, and many on-time projects don't deliver any value. Instead, think in terms of organizational, technical, and personal success."_


What it takes to build such software:






	
  * **Great code**: Easily Testable, Maintainable & Scalable code across ALL Tiers of the App

	
  * **Constant estimating and planning**: Has to be woven into the Iterative Release process

	
  * **Feedback Management**: Collection & Processing of Qualitative & Quantitative Feedback

	
  * **Continuous Improvement**: A team habit of proactively finding and fixing problems

	
  * **Good Infrastructure**: S/W & H/W tools to improve Team & Apps efficiency

	
  * **High Quality**: Focus on all [4 Agile Testing](http://onestepbacktwostepsforward.blogspot.com/2009/06/agile-testing-quadrants.html) Quadrants

	
  * **Constant Communication**: Customer Collaboration & Team Interaction along with just enough Documentation

	
  * **Great Design**: Balancing Form with Function

	
  * **Constant UX Focus**: Focus on the user's interactive experience [along with focus on Copy] woven into the Iterative Release Process. This is covered by Quadrant 3 in the Agile Testing diagram linked to above - but I'm mentioning it separately because its usually happens to get less attention.

	
  * **Knowledgeable, Skilled and Motivated Team**: Important roles include Managers, Programmers, Testers, Analysts, Leads, Architects and Designers
