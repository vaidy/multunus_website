We started speaking at conferences last year. We've also been doing a fair bit of writing. This post rounds up what we've up to - along with links to our presentations and some of what we've written.

**Presentations [in Chronological Order]**

**DevOpsDays 2011: **Leena gave a lightning talk on "Push Button Deployment with Jenkins". [Here's the presentation](http://sliwww.slideshare.net/leenasn/push-button-deployment-using-jenkins).

**DroidCon India 2011: **We gave two talks at this conference:



	
  * Leena and I co-presented on "Continuous Delivery for an Android application". Here's the [original proposal](http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/83-continuous-delivery-for-an-android-application) and [here's the link to the prezi](http://prezi.com/56ueprf0mkql/continuous-delivery-on-android/). Here's a [short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=uNvjNIK1EEU) where Leena and I describe the talk.

	
  * Tamil and KP gave an intro to OpenGL on Android. Here's the [original proposal](http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/94-introduction-to-opengl-in-android) and here's the [link to the presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/tamillarasan/introduction-to-openglinandroid?from=ss_embed).


**Agile India 2012**: Leena and I spoke there on "Continuous Delivery for a Song". Here's the link to the [original proposal](http://submit2012india.agilealliance.org/node/8894). And here's the [link to the presentation](https://docs.google.com/a/multunus.com/present/view?id=0AQj1177vtu0MZHRoM2dmN180NzRneGp2bXRndw). It was a live demo - and by the comments we got from our audience, we think it went off fairly well.

**Recent Writing: **An article I wrote for YourStory.in was published late last year. It was titled "[Mobile App Opportunities in 2012](http://yourstory.in/2011/12/a-sneak-peek-into-mobile-app-opportunities-in-2012/)".

**Blogging:** Leena has written a lot of articles on Continuous Delivery [on this blog itself](http://www.multunus.com/blog/all/continuous-delivery/). And Akshay [has been writing regularly](http://akshayatmultunus.wordpress.com/) since he joined us last year.

I hope you found this round up useful. I expect the Agile India organizers to upload videos of the all the talks soon. Once that happens, I'll update this post with the link to the video of our talk there.
