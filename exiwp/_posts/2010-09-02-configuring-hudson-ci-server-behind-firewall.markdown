When firewall was introducedÂ within our local network, the Hudson server stopped working with the error:

    
    javax.jmdns.impl.tasks.Prober run
    WARNING: run() exception
    java.io.IOException: Operation not permitted
    at java.net.PlainDatagramSocketImpl.send(Native Method)
    at java.net.DatagramSocket.send(DatagramSocket.java:625)
    at javax.jmdns.impl.JmDNSImpl.send(JmDNSImpl.java:1200)
    at javax.jmdns.impl.tasks.Prober.run(Prober.java:163)
    at java.util.TimerThread.mainLoop(Timer.java:512)
    at java.util.TimerThread.run(Timer.java:462)


And when you access hudson in browser, it stays with the message **_"Please wait while Hudson is getting ready to work...."_**__ forever.

Initially I thought the problem might be because the ports which are required by the Hudson server i.e. 8080 and 5353, were not opened in the Firewall. I opened those, but the error remained.

After googling for sometime, I could find similar issues being reported here:

[http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-7129?page=com.atlassian.streams.streams-jira-plugin:activity-stream-issue-tab](http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-7129?page=com.atlassian.streams.streams-jira-plugin:activity-stream-issue-tab)

And the issue got fixed by adding

    
    -Dhudson.DNSMultiCast.disabled=true


to the java command as follows:

    
    java -Dhudson.DNSMultiCast.disabled=true -jar hudson.war --httpPort=8080
