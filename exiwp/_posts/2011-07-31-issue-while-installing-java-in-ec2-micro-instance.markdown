When I tried to install Java in our [EC2 micro instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), it stopped responding. There was no luck even after restarting the instance. I thought it might be a specific issue with that particular instance, so tried it again by bringing up a new micro instance and every time it was the same behaviour. I then googled and discovered it as a known [issue](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/634487) reported back in September 2010. The suggested workaround is:



	
  * Bring up a small instance

	
  * Install Java

	
  * Convert it into micro instance.


Converting of the instance can be done using [API tools](http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/351), or from the [AWS Console](http://www.kinlane.com/2011/03/easier-scalability-with-aws/). But for me this option was never enabled from the console. I don't know why. Of course, the API option would still work, I suppose.

But after looking at the bug in detail, I could see a solution which uses the linux [nice](http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_nice.htm) command, and that did the trick for me. You can see the script as the last comment. The script is as follows:

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb <a href="http://archive.canonical.com/" rel="nofollow">http://archive.canonical.com/</a> natty partner"
    sudo apt-get update
    #Accept the Java license.
    for i in bin jdk jre; do
    echo "sun-java6-$i shared/accepted-sun-dlj-v1-1 select true" | sudo debconf-set-selections
    done
    # convoluted way to install java. this seems to only work some times! Race condition?

    sudo nice --adjustment=19 apt-get install -y sun-java6-jre
