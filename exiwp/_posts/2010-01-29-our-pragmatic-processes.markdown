One of the things we do is to create a culture of continuous improvement. To help ourselves stay on track and not lose sight of the forest for the trees, we do the following:








	
  * We do our standups a little different. We talk about what we **learned** yesterday than what we got done. Credit for this idea goes to [HashRocket](http://www.hashrocket.com/)

	
  * Encourage our people to read awesome books [[Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) and [Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/) are our current favourites] and then share what they read in our standups. It only takes 30min [or less] to read enough to share something useful in the next day's standup.

	
  * Encourage our people to be generalists rather than specialists. This approach has resulted in most of our people being [polyglots](http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2006/12/polyglot-programming.html).

	
  * We've woven UX improvement into our sprints. This results in software that's balanced both in terms of user interaction and functionality.

	
  * Test Driven Development: We're yet to get completely infected by this discipline. But we're getting there.

	
  * Not interrupting each other: It takes 15min for people to regain their "flow" if they get interrupted. And if this happens many times in a day, we end up with a stressed out team at the end of each long day. So we prefer patience to instant gratification. [Tip: [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) is a great tool in this regard. We prefer this to IM].





We'll be blogging about some of the above topics in more detail in the coming weeks. Do drop a line in the comments section below, if you'd like to learn more about anything specifically.
