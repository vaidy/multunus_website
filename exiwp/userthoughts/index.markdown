![UserThoughts](http://new.multunus.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/product-engineering/196__320x240_userthoughts.png)UserThoughts is our first product out of the Multunus stable. While we’ve always been inspired to build highly usable applications for our clients, we’d get surprised by the feedback of the users who tried out early versions of these applications.

We built UserThoughts to make it easy to receive continuous **video feedback** on the products we build for our clients. Along the way we’ve discovered that this is a product that could be helpful to a lot of other companies out there as well.

The product is currently in alpha.

**Technologies Used:** Java Media Framework, Ruby on Rails, JQuery, Amazon Web Services, Cucumber, Selenium
