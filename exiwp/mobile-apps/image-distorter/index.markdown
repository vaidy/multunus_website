![Image Distorter](http://new.multunus.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/avi-manipulators/image_distorter3.png)This app allows the user to load an image and then apply a variety of different effects on the image. These effects include  smearing, growing, shrinking etc within defined spaces on the image.

The app is still in development and hence in stealth mode. The video below however, gives you a glimpse of what we’re working on.

Technology

The primary technology in use are OpenGL ES 2 along with GL SL [Shading Language].

Note: We’re also building this on the iOS platform.
