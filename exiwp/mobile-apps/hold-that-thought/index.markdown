![Hold That Thought](http://new.multunus.com/wordpress/wp-content/gallery/avi-manipulators/hold_that_thought.png)This app is still in stealth mode. Hence we cannot divulge details.  But we can say one thing: Its an audio recording application with a very interesting and unique twist!

The one piece that we can talk about is the mp3 conversion part. The audio is first recorded as raw PCM data and then transcoded into CD quality mp3 format â€“ all within the phone itself.  Watch the video below to see component of the app in action.

**Technical Details**

The Android NDK along with JNI wrappers were used extensively in this application to talk to native C++ code.  This ensures good performance of the app.
