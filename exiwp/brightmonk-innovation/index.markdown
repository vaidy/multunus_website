BMI is an innovation services firm specializing in venture design, product development and advisory services for entrepreneurs and investors. They’re based out of Phoenix, AZ.
  

Multunus has been BMI’s technology solutions partner since 2008. During this time we’ve built more than half a dozen products together. Most of them from scratch.
  






We’ve successfully applied the offshore-onshore model to help many startups go from an idea to full products. All of these products were built with an agile “mindset” of collaboration and communication. 
  

At this point, we’re working in a lean startup model - that encourages a lot more experimentation and validation of assumptions - while rapidly releasing new version of the product every week.
