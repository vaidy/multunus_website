		<h1>Why Us?</h1>
		<h1>Agile/XP (for real)</h1>

		<p>What is agile? Is it a process? A methodology? A set of practices? At one level it is all of those.<br />
	But at another level, its a set of <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" title="values">values</a> and <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" title="principles">principles</a>. <br />
	At yet another level, its a <b>mindset</b>.</p>

		<p>At Multunus, we like to think that it is our agile mindset that has helped us get to where we are right now &#8211; happy customers, happy team and easily maintainable software.</p>

		<p>James Shore says it best in his book &#8211; <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/why_agile.html" title="book">The Art of Agile Development</a>.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><br />
	Agile development is popular, but that&#8217;s no reason to use it. The real question: will agile development make your team more successful?</p>


		<p>Success is usually defined as delivering on time, under budget, and as specified. That&#8217;s a flawed definition. Many late projects are huge successes for their organizations, and many on-time projects don&#8217;t deliver any value. Instead, think in terms of organizational, technical, and personal success.</p>

		<p>Agile development is no silver bullet, but it is useful. Organizationally, agile delivers value and reduces costs; technically, it highlights excellence and minimal bugs; personally, many find it their preferred way to work.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Extreme Programming [XP] is the agile methodology that we follow at Multunus. We don’t want to start a flame war here, but it has been said to be the most “complete” among agile processes. </p>

		<p>The following diagram provides a 10,000ft level view of XP. As you might imagine, practicing XP required a good amount of discipline across the team. What’s perhaps most rewarding though is the environment of creativity that XP fosters within the team. </p>

	Are you wondering whether it’s even possible to practice all of the above <b>38 practices</b> everyday? Then you owe it yourself to talk to us <span id="continuous-delivery-section">TODAY!.</span></p>

		<h1>Continuous Delivery [CD]</h1></p>

		<p>Keeping a lot of software inventory is not a good idea. The longer the code remains outside of production, the greater the chance that it will become irrelevant, sooner than later.</p>

		<p>Software is only useful when it is in the hands of the user. It therefore beckons us to do everything we can to deliver software as frequently as possible to the end user. And by frequent, we mean at least once a week &#8211; and ideally <em>more than once a day</em>.</p>

		<p>At Multunus, we&#8217;ve following the above model of software delivery since mid-2011. While this model of delivery is suggested for almost any type of project, it is mandatory for <strong>Lean Startups</strong>.</p>

		<p>Besides automated testing and continuous integration, setting up a CD system also involves setting up the following:</p>
		<p>
	<ul><br />
	<li>A Build Pipeline</li><br />
	<li>A Push Button [or one-click] Deployment system</li><br />
	<li>A Configuration Management system</li><br />
	</ul><br />
	Take a look at the following video [< 2 min] to get a bird's overview of the CD system that we've setup at Multunus. <em>Apologies for the poor quality of the video.</em></p>

		<p>Beyond the above, implementing a CD system requires the following skills:<br />
	<ul><br />
	<li>Feature Toggling</li><br />
	<li>Plan and delivering features in small increments</li><br />
	<li>Identifying and automating anything and everything that is repetitive</li><br />
	</ul><br />
	We&#8217;ve written and spoken about CD a fair bit since late 2011:</p>

		<p><strong>Continuous Delivery Blog Post Series:</strong> We&#8217;ve written a lot of posts on CD. You can <a href="/blog/categories/continuous-delivery/">find them all here</a>.

		<p>*DroidCon India 2011:  *The topic was “Continuous Delivery for an Android application”. Here’s the <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/83-continuous-delivery-for-an-android-application">original proposal</a> and <a href="http://prezi.com/56ueprf0mkql/continuous-delivery-on-android/">here’s the link to the prezi</a>. The following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&#38;v=uNvjNIK1EEU">short video</a> is a preview we recorded before the talk:</p>

		<p><strong>Agile India 2012</strong>: We spoke there on “Continuous Delivery for a Song”. Here’s the link to the <a href="http://submit2012india.agilealliance.org/node/8894">original proposal</a>.

It was a live demo – and by the comments we got from our audience, we think it went off fairly well.<br />
