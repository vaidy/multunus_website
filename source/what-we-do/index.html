	<h1>What We Do</h1>
	<p>We’re a custom software development boutique. We build Web and Mobile applications that are inherently complex and risky.</p>

	<p>Whether you’re a startup looking for a technology partner or an established business in need of specialized technical expertise, we can help you.
	<h3>Technology Summary</h3></p>

	<div style="padding-left: 10px;">

	On the web application front:
	<ul>
	    <li>We strongly prefer <strong>Ruby on Rails </strong>on the server side for new web projects. But if you've invested in Java already, we could still work together</li>
	    <li>At the browser end, <strong>HTML5/CSS3</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong> and <strong>Backbone.js</strong> are our primary technology choices.</li>
	</ul>
	On the mobile front, we build:
	<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	    <li><strong>Native iOS</strong> applications using Objective-C</li>
	    <li><strong>Native Android</strong> applications using Java and C++</li>
	    <li><strong>Cross-platform mobile</strong> applications using PhoneGap</li>
	</ul>
	Finally, <strong id="web-app">all of our code is Test-Driven</strong>. So that includes Javascript, iOS and Android native code too.

	</div>

	<p><h1>Web Applications</h1></p>

	<p><h2>Domains</h2></p>

	<p>We've built web applications in the following domains:</p>

	<ul>
	<ul>
	    <li>Finance</li>
	    <li>Consumer</li>
	    <li>Education</li>
	    <li>Health</li>
	    <li>Local</li>
	    <li>Product Engineering</li>
	</ul>
	</ul>

	<p><h2>Technologies</h2></p>

	<p><h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Ruby on Rails with JQuery</h3></p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">We’ve been working with RoR from 2008. And have seen Rails evolve from version [2.x.x] to version [3.x.x].  We’ve also worked with JRuby extensively.</p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>RoR Testing Stack:</em> While we’ve done a fair bit of work using Cucumber, we prefer just sticking to RSpec for the most part. This combined with performance enhancement tools such as Spork - is now our bread and butter.</p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Javascript Testing Stack:</em> For Javascript code, we write tests using Jasmine. And we use JSTestdriver to ensure they’re cross-browser platform compliant.</p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">Here’s a sample of the applications that we’ve built on RoR:</p>

	<ul>
	<ul style="padding-left: 80px;">
	    <li><a title="Publink" href="web-applications/publink">A Location Aware REST API</a> that is consumed by iPhone apps and web based Widgets</li>
	    <li><a title="ElixirHealth" href="web-applications/elixirhealth">A good looking local deals site in the wellness space</a>. It also has microsites for local business and a large number of health articles. A CMS backend powers the site.</li>
	</ul>

	<p></ul>
	<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Spring and Hibernate</h3></p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">As mentioned above, our strong preference (when building new applications) - is to use Ruby on Rails. But if you've got an existing Java application that you want to enhance, the rest of this section will be relevant to you.</p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">Our experience with Spring and Hibernate goes back to 2002. And during this time, our team has built almost a dozen products on this framework. More recently we’ve worked with the augmented stack which includes tools such as Spring ROO.</p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">Our testing stack: Junit</p>

	<p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">Here’s a sample of the applications that we’ve built with the above stack:</p>

	<ul>
	<ul style="padding-left: 80px;">
	    <li><a title="iComp" href="web-applications/icomp">An ETL [Extract, Transform, Load] system</a> that processes a database of <strong>200+ Million records</strong> containing financial data of companies across the world.</li>
	    <li>An online social shopping platform that aggregates data across hundreds of online retailers in the US. <a title="Contact Us" name="mob-app" href="/contact-us/contact"></a>Please contact us for more information about this.</li>
	</ul>

	<p></ul>
	<h1>Mobile Applications</h1></p>

	<div>
	<h2 id="games" style="padding-left: 30px;">PhoneGap and HTML5 Applications</h2>


	<p style="padding-left: 60px;"> All of our current mobile work is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhoneGap" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a> and HTML5. These apps typically consume web services exposed by a web application hosted on the cloud. Some highlights:


	<ul style="padding-left: 80px;">
	    <li>We've extended the PhoneGap API with Objective C - to perform operations not yet supported by HTML5. This includes operations such as "recording audio" using the device's microphone</li>
	    <li>We've built "single page" HTML5 web applications that work with very little code changes on both the desktop and as a native app on the iPad</li>
	    <li>We've built cross platform based applications that work seamlessly across  iOS, Android and the Blackberry platforms.</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="padding-left:60px;">The most significant work that we've done using PhoneGap is for Narrable - a closed Beta application that we're currently working on. If you'd like to know more about our work in this space, <a href="/contact-us/contact/">talk to us</a>.

	<h2 style="padding-left: 30px;">Native Applications</h2>


	<p style="padding-left:60px;">This section has an overview of the types of native applications that we've built. We do not however build "standalone" native apps anymore. Our forte is in building mobile applications that have a significant cloud component to them.

	<div style="padding-left: 80px;">
	<ul>
	    <li>Accelerometer based games</li>
