bio: <p>Chala as we call Chalapathi, is our facilities in-charge. He has been with Multunus since the beginning(actually even before Multunus started). He is our one point contact for all office needs. He is the first person to arrive at the office and the last to leave, on most days. He can multi-task with great ease. He is our designated office assistant, chef, gardener and chauffeur. He is always available for our requests to scan, print, or any other errands. In the few minutes that he gets as a breather, he engages us in his lively banter, cracking jokes and laughing. His openness, attitude and willingness to help has won all our hearts, from our junior-most developer to the CEO.</p><p>Our garden which is so colorful and pleasing to the eye is the fruit of his labor(check out the photo on our site). What to say about his coffee and sandwiches? Yummy!  So how does he do all of this? With a smile! He so effortlessly manages his time to cater to our work needs. He focuses on keeping us happy at work so that we can focus on keeping our clients happy.</p>
