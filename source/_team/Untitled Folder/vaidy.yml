bio: <p>A believer in lifelong learning, Vaidy is dedicated to constant self-improvement and encourages the same in the entire Multunus team. An experienced technologist and product developer, Vaidy went over to the "dark side" of management when he left the corporate world of software development and ventured out on his own to launch Multunus.</p>

<p>Truthfully though, Vaidy is a proud geek at heart who transitions effortlessly from conversations on cloud computing to dialogues on data structuresâ€¦ But his real geek enthu is often best demonstrated through the "PJs" (poor/pathetic jokes) he subjects the team too.</p>

<p>Vaidy has steered the Multunus team from inception and has fostered a culture of customer thinking, lean development, product orientation, and entrepreneurship throughout the organization.</p>
