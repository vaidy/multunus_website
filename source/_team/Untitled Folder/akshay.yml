bio: "	<p>We’d probably need to write 5 long paragraphs on Akshay to describe everything he’s achieved in the short time he’s been working with us at Multunus. So we’ll use bullets instead to convey our message:<br />
<ul class=""list_near_image""><br />
<li>Super frequent (and consistent!) blogger [Check out <a href="http://akshayatmultunus.wordpress.com/">akshayatmultunus.wordpress.com</a>]</li><br />
<li>Customer Service Fanatic</li><br />
<li>He’ll be known as the one who turned down a “safe” and cosy job at a large company – just to work with us</li><br />
<li>Super fun to be with</li><br />
<li>Part of the Multunus Campus Interview team</li><br />
</ul><br />
If the above list seems long to you, here’s two more things to keep in mind about him:<br />
<ul><br />
<li>His dedication is unparalleled. We are ready to place a bet that you will not be able to find someone who’s more dedicated than Akshay.</li><br />
<li>If you wanted to understand what a passionate programmer is all about, your can either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development-Pragmatic/dp/1934356344">read the book</a> or just meet Akshay in person.</li><br />
</ul><br />
