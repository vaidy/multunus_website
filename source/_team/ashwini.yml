bio: <p>Learning how to manage your own time is something you can learn from Ashwini. She travels no less than 30 kms (18 miles) a day to get to work each day! And if you don’t find her in her seat by 10AM every single day, then we’d say your eyes probably need checking. Because Ashwini’s consistency is something that bewilders all of us here at Multunus.</p><p>Ashwini juggles exploratory testing, analysis of requirements and process monitoring every day. How she does that without going crazy is something we’re not entirely sure of – but we have no complaints.</p>
