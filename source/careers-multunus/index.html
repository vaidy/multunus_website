	<h1>Careers</h1>
	<p>You&#8217;ve come to the right place if you&#8217;re looking for a workplace that invests deeply in the professional growth of its employees. Here&#8217;s a few ways that we do that:<br />
	<ul><br />
	<li>We&#8217;ve implemented our own version of the 20% time that Google is famous for. You get to spend 45 minutes everyday learning and interacting with your colleagues.</li><br />
	<li>We ask everyone to leave by 7PM everyday. And working weekends are strongly discouraged.</li><br />
	<li>We constantly invest in some of the best training material available</li><br />
	<li>We invite industry leaders to visit our office and interact with the team here. We call these events &#8220;fireside chats&#8221;</li><br />
	<li>We have lunch together on Wednesdays &#8211; so that all of us get an hour to discuss anything that&#8217;s we want to</li><br />
	<li>We conduct hacknights</li><br />
	</ul></p>

	<p>We also take everyone out to lunch and dinner every couple of months. We do  team trips to interesting places. We&#8217;ve got a fully stocked snack bar within the office &#8216;coz hungry employees are no fun to work with. And we celebrate birthday&#8217;s and anniversaries &#8211; and anything else, that calls for a celebration :).</p>

		<p>If your question is not answered below or you’re impatient, feel free to reach out to us using the contact information given above.</p>

		<p><a href="#id1">Q: What do you look for in candidates for your developer positions?</a><br />
	<a href="#id2">Q: How many rounds of interviews do you have?</a><br />
	<a href="#id3">Q: What are the steps in the hiring process?</a><br />
	<a href="#id4">Q: What languages am I allowed to use for the programming rounds?</a><br />
	<a href="#id5">Q: Will the in-person interview take a lot of time? </a><br />
	<a href="#id6">Q: I’ll probably not be able to come down to Bangalore for the in-person rounds. Can these be conducted remotely?</a><br />
	<a href="#id7">Q: I will need to travel a long way to Bangalore to attend the in-person round. Will you re-imburse the cost of my travel?</a></p>

		<p><strong id="id1">Q: What do you look for in candidates for your developer positions?</strong><br />
	A love for programming and a great attitude are the fundamental requirements. For details, please check the <a href="#open_positions">Open Positions</a> section above.</p>

		<p><strong id="id2">Q: How many rounds of interviews do you have?</strong><br />
	Usually 4-5 rounds. But the interview process is agile in nature. What this means, is that we’ll have as many rounds as is required for us to make our decision. Generally though, 3-4 of our colleagues will interact with you – over phone calls, in-person conversations and a pair-programming assignment</p>

		<p><strong id="id3">Q: What are the steps in the hiring process?</strong><br />
	We require all candidates to fill up our online forms. You can find them <a href="?page_id=111">here</a>. If we like your profile, one of our senior engineers will reach out to you by email or a phone call. Depending on the situation, we’ll either invite you over for a test at our office premises in Bangalore or have a preliminary discussion with you on phone. Assuming that step goes well, we’ll follow up with the next rounds quickly and if possible, try and complete the entire process in a day’s time.</p>

		<p><strong id="id4">Q: What languages am I allowed to use for the programming rounds?</strong><br />
	We’re mostly language and platform agnostic in our approach to problem solving, at Multunus. Hence you get to pick the platform of your choice and we’ll set up a development environment according to your taste.</p>

		<p><strong id="id5">Q: Will the in-person interview take a lot of time?</strong><br />
	Yes, please plan to spend 4-6 hours at our office on the day you’re invited to come over.</p>

		<p><strong id="id6">Q: I’ll probably not be able to come down to Bangalore for the in-person rounds. Can these be conducted remotely?</strong><br />
	If you cannot make it in person for some reason, we’ll try and conduct these “personal” rounds via a Skype video call. But that would be an exception, rather than the rule.</p>

		<p><strong id="id7">Q: I will need to travel a long way to Bangalore to attend the in-person round. Will you re-imburse the cost of my travel?</strong><br />
	Yes, sometimes we do. If you’d like us to re-imburse your travel expenses, please make sure to check with us first before planning your travel. Based on the specific situation, we’ll make a decision and let you know.</p>
