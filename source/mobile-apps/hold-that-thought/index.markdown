  <p><img src="/images/hold_that_thought.png" alt="Hold That Thought" title="Hold That Thought" />This app is still in stealth mode. Hence we cannot divulge details.  But we can say one thing: Its an audio recording application with a very interesting and unique twist!</p>

  <p>The one piece that we can talk about is the mp3 conversion part. The audio is first recorded as raw PCM data and then transcoded into CD quality mp3 format â€“ all within the phone itself.  Watch the video below to see component of the app in action.</p>

  <p><strong>Technical Details</strong></p>

  <p>The Android NDK along with JNI wrappers were used extensively in this application to talk to native C++ code.  This ensures good performance of the app.</p>
