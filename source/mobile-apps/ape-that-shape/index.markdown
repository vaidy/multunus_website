  <p><img src="/images/apethatshape_game.png" alt="ApeThatShape" title="" />Draw anything on the screen by just flexing your wrists! The built-in Shape Detector can recognize almost any shape.</p>

  <p>The game is a fun app that starts with simple shapes and then gradually moves on to more complex ones. The player is not allowed to touch the screen and has to draw the shapes entirely by tilting the phone.</p>
  <p>This application is also potentially useful to train children who need help with their motor skills.</p>
