We've been using <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> as our Project Management Tool so far, but realized that it would not work as a Kanban Tool as the implementation is entirely different. I am not going to talk about "Why Kanban", because there are many articles and books which talks about the same. But I am talking about how did we evaluate different tools and choose KanbanTool in the end.
<p>
The different tools we evaluated are:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://leankit.com/">LeanKit</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://kanbanery.com/">Kanbanery</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://kanbantool.com/">KanbanTool</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  We started off by comparing the features from the point of view of Kanban, but later realized that the features provided by Pivotal Tracker, especially the collaboration and tasks are very much important. Then we came up with a set of criteria which included both Kanban and non-Kanban requirements. You can see the criteria that we've used for evaluating the tool and our findings in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApUPwJdQvqT_dEJuS25YZzMwWkJVc0NXWXhIbUhaQ1E&usp=sharing">this</a> document.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> was also considered but it does not provide features such as WIP limit, cycle and lead time reporting etc. which are the key for Kanban. But we found that there is a Google Chrome Extension which can be used for adding <a href="https://github.com/NateHark/TrelloWIPLimits">WIP(Work in Progress) limit</a> in Trello. And similarly other extensions exists too. But we felt its a very good tool which can used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a>, but may not be a good candidate as Kanban.
</p>
 Lastly, I would like to mention those articles which helped us to understand Kanban better. Those are:
