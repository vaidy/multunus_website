<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Problem</span></strong> 
<p>
  We have some projects which takes lot of effort to set up. As with every projects setting up development environment includes installing git, curl, apache, mysql-server, ruby, rvm, ruby-gems for the app, etc. and also the project specific configurations.
</p>
<p>
  Doing all these every time when you need to setup the development environment will be time consuming and takes a lot of effort.
</p>
<strong><span style= "text-decoration: underline;">Solution</span></strong>
<p>
  Setting up the development environment in VM using Vagrant. 
</p>
<p>
  Vagrant helps to build development environment for projects and rebuild them when needed. And this environment can be shared among the team easily.
</p>
<strong><span style= "text-decoration: underline;">How?</span></strong>
<p>
  Vagrant is primarily a driver for Oracle VirtualBox virtual machines. You can download and install Vagrant from <a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/" target="_NEW">here</a> or you can install it as a ruby gem for the rails projects. Vagrant uses a "base box" which is a base install (an OS) for the system you are going to use.
</p>
<p>
  Different flavours of base boxes can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/" target="_NEW">http://www.vagrantbox.es/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  First step is to mark the root directory and setup the basic required files using the following command:
  <pre>vagrant init</pre>
</p>
<p>
  This will create a file called <em><strong>Vagrantfile</strong></em> this will contain the configuration details for the VM.
</p>
<p>
  After the project initailization you can download Vagrant boxes from <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/" target="_NEW">http://www.vagrantbox.es/</a> and add it to your project:
  <pre>vagrant box add lucid64 lucid64.box </pre>
</p>
<p>
  You can also add the box from a remote server using:
  <pre>vagrant box add lucid64 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid64.box</pre>
</p>
<p>
  To list the boxes that you added you can use:
  <pre>vagrant box list</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Now you have to edit the Vagrantfile to use the base box that you have added.
  <pre>Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
        config.vm.box = "lucid64" 
end</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Now we can start our new VM:
  <pre>vagrant up</pre>
  This will start a fully functional VM. 
</p>
<p>
  To access the VM you have to do ssh:
  <pre>vagrant ssh</pre>
  This will log you into the virtual machine.
</p>
<p>
  Now you can start setting up the development environment. Once everything is ready we can package this VM to a box. This will help us to share the virtual environment that we created with the other team members.
  <pre>vagrant package</pre>
  This will create a vagrant box with the entire dev environment setup. 
</p>
<p>
  Now to use this any machine, you have to install Virtualbox and Vagrant. Then add this box using:
  <pre>vagrant box add lucid64_with_dev_setup package.box</pre>
</p>
<p>
  You can create a VM with this box and all the dev environment setup will be available with this VM.
</p>
