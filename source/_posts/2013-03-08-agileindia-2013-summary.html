This is the summary about the  recently concluded <a href="http://2013.agileindia.org/">Agile India Conference 2013</a>. 
This gave me a chance to interact with great legends and leaders of software industry such as 
Linda Rising, Mary Poppendieck, Henrik Kniberg, Jez Humble, Jeff Patton, Fred George, Craig Larman, Neil Ford, Venkat Subramaniam, 
Aslam Khan, Karl Scotland, Kenji Hiranabe, Laurent Bossavit, Rebecca Parsons etc. and listen to them multiple times in the span of 4 days.  Amazing.
<p>
I am not going to write about each session what I attended, am instead trying to summarize what I learned during those 4 days both by attending the sessions and by interacting to them during those 4 days:
<ul>
	<li> Never stop learning and experiment continuously. </li>
	<li> Experiments may fail, but learn from it and move on.</li>
	<li> Analyse why am I doing, and be innovative. If you delay innovation, it becomes worse.</li>
 	<li>Great software can be created only with collaboration. So work as a team and share the responsibilities.</li>
 	<li>Be a good coach rather being authoritative which should help to implement change effectively.</li>
 	<li>Optimise the entire delivery instead of just optimising the development process. Kanban helps to achieve the same. </li>
 	<li>Have tight feedback cycles by applying timeboxing mercilessly. This will help for continuous learning and improvement. Eg: 15 minutes with TDD cycles which result in simple design with refactorings, Frequent Retrospectives etc.</li>
 	<li>Apply Last Responsible Moment across, eg: Emergent Design and Evolutionary Architecture by looking at Code complexity and other coding smells.</li>
 	<li>You can defer writing tests until the validation of feature is done. Adding acceptance tests for stability can deferred when you feel that it's time to have more stability</li>

Thanks a ton to Naresh Jain and team for organising such a wonderful event. Curious to know what's coming for Agile India 2014.</p>
