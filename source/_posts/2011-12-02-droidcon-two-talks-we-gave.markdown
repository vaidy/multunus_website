<img style="margin: 0px 12px;" src="/images/tamil-and-kp.png" alt="" align="left" />This talk was on Second day of the Droidcon given by Tamil KP. The objective of talk was to have people get started with OpenGL programming which can seem to be a little heavy but it need not be. The talk started with a brief introduction to OpenGL and then had quick step-by-step tutorial demonstration. <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/droidcon/94-introduction-to-opengl-in-android">More details here</a>.
