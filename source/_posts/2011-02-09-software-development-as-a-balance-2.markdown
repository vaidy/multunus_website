Why is delivering good software on a consistent basis hard? There are many existing answers to this question already. This is our version.

A list of things good software should achieve:
<ul>
	<li>Should solve a real problem</li>
	<li>Should be shipped and maintained within the budgeted cost and time</li>
	<li>Should be easy to use</li>
</ul>
<strong>Update: </strong>We've now migrated to <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/why_agile.html">James Shore's definition</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: verdana, 'trebuchet MS', helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; font-size: small;"><em>"Success is usually defined as delivering on time, under budget, and as specified. That's a flawed definition. Many late projects are huge successes for their organizations, and many on-time projects don't deliver any value. Instead, think in terms of organizational, technical, and personal success."</em></span></p>
What it takes to build such software:
<div id="_mcePaste">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Great code</strong>: Easily Testable, Maintainable &amp; Scalable code across ALL Tiers of the App</li>
	<li><strong>Constant estimating and planning</strong>: Has to be woven into the Iterative Release process</li>
	<li><strong>Feedback Management</strong>: Collection &amp; Processing of Qualitative &amp; Quantitative Feedback</li>
	<li><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: A team habit of proactively finding and fixing problems</li>
	<li><strong>Good Infrastructure</strong>: S/W &amp; H/W tools to improve Team &amp; Apps efficiency</li>
	<li><strong>High Quality</strong>: Focus on all <a href="http://onestepbacktwostepsforward.blogspot.com/2009/06/agile-testing-quadrants.html">4 Agile Testing</a> Quadrants</li>
	<li><strong>Constant Communication</strong>: Customer Collaboration &amp; Team Interaction along with just enough Documentation</li>
	<li><strong>Great Design</strong>: Balancing Form with Function</li>
	<li><strong>Constant UX Focus</strong>: Focus on the user's interactive experience [along with focus on Copy] woven into the Iterative Release Process. This is covered by Quadrant 3 in the Agile Testing diagram linked to above - but I'm mentioning it separately because its usually happens to get less attention.</li>
	<li><strong>Knowledgeable, Skilled and Motivated Team</strong>: Important roles include Managers, Programmers, Testers, Analysts, Leads, Architects and Designers</li>
</ul>
