<div>2009 was a year of many special events. We completed 2 years of operations last year. We moved to a new more spacious office. We created our first <a id="bgtx" title="product" href="http://alpha.userthoughts.com/" target="_blank">product</a>. We discovered our niche [more on this in the coming weeks].</div>
<div>But those events are nothing more than punctuations in this journey we've embarked on. Its the learnings that we treasure and rely on, to propel us forward. So here's my list:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li> <strong>Constraints enforce creativity</strong>. Last year was difficult for almost everybody and we were no exception. Client work diminished rapidly and soon our team of passionate, talented engineers were finally "available", to do some creative work for ourselves. We were forced to innovate at this time. And we did. We came up with the idea of <a id="kowt" title="UserThoughts" href="http://alpha.userthoughts.com/">UserThoughts</a> and got the first prototype out in less than 2 months.</li>
	<li> <strong>Resilience pays. </strong>There are now clear signs that the worst is behind us and that 2010 will be a year of robust growth. But mid-last year, the situation was quite different. To look beyond the current and work towards a better future, requires faith and dedication. Last year has proven that our team is built with that kind of DNA.</li>
	<li> <strong>Integrity pays. </strong>Its hard to do the right thing, every time. But I just took a look at our "ethics account book", and so far, we're quite profitable :-). We create value for our clients with a sincere intention that they should succeed in their respective businesses. And sooner or later, this gets noticed.</li>
	<li> <strong>Passion results in new ideas. </strong>We've always been obsessed with user experience. So much so that, we've weaved a high level of focus on UX into our development cycles. Its probably not an accident then, that, our product seeks to solve problems in this very space.</li>
</ul>
