<a href="http://iain.nl/easier-metricfu-with-metrical">Metrical</a> is for easier <a href="http://metric-fu.rubyforge.org/">metric_fu</a> setup. You can see the details on why and how <a href="http://iain.nl/easier-metricfu-with-metrical">here</a>. Its an awesome tool which allows us to easily use metric_fu without adding any dependency to the project code.

The steps I followed for setting it up in our Jenkins server are:
<ul>
	<li> Install the gem. I installed it under our ruby 1.9.2 in RVM.</li>
	<li> Create a .metrics file under your projects directory with the settings. This is not mandatory, but I had to use this because some configurations do not seem to be working with ruby 1.9.2. I've mentioned those below along with the contents of the .metrics file</li>
	<li> Create a job in Jenkins server, mention the repository details and for build step give the shell command as <em>rvm 1.9.2 -S metrical</em></li>
	<li> Configure the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin">HTML Publisher plugin</a> for showing the nice Graphs generated by metric_fu as part of the build report. The default report location is tmp/metric_fu/output under the project directory. You can change the same in .metrics file.</li>
</ul>
As I mentioned above, tools such as flay and flog, which comes as part of metric_fu, have <a href="https://github.com/iain/metrical/issues/4">issues</a> working with ruby 1.9.2. And the same case with stats graph and syntax highlighting. The same case with <a href="https://github.com/relevance/rcov/issues/8">rcov</a> also. So I had to create a <em><strong>.metrics</strong></em> file with the following contents and put in the project dir:

<span style="font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; line-height: 18px;"> </span>

[sourcecode language="ruby"]
MetricFu::Configuration.run do |config|
        config.code_dirs = ['app', 'lib']
        config.syntax_highlighting = false
        config.metrics  = [:churn,:reek,:roodi,:hotspots,:rails_best_practices]
        config.graphs   = [:reek, :roodi, :rails_best_practices]
        config.rcov[:test_files] = ['spec/**/*_spec.rb']
        config.rcov[:rcov_opts] &lt;&lt; &quot;-Ispec&quot; # Needed to find spec_helper
end
[/sourcecode]

For test coverage I've used <a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">Simplecov</a> which is easy to setup. It will generate the coverage report whenever you run the tests. This also generated html report which can be integrated easily into Jenkins. As mentioned <a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov/issues/42">here</a> in the issue list, it does not generate the report when you are running with <a href="https://github.com/timcharper/spork/wiki">spork</a>.
