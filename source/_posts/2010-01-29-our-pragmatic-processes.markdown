<div>One of the things we do is to create a culture of continuous improvement. To help ourselves stay on track and not lose sight of the forest for the trees, we do the following:</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>We do our standups a little different. We talk about what we <strong>learned</strong> yesterday than what we got done. Credit for this idea goes to <a id="lq5t" title="HashRocket" href="http://www.hashrocket.com/">HashRocket</a></li>
	<li>Encourage our people to read awesome books [<a id="gldl" title="Pragmatic Programmer" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">Pragmatic Programmer</a> and <a id="wjn0" title="Getting Real" href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a> are our current favourites] and then share what they read in our standups. It only takes 30min [or less] to read enough to share something useful in the next day's standup.</li>
	<li>Encourage our people to be generalists rather than specialists. This approach has resulted in most of our people being <a id="mni_" title="polyglots" href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2006/12/polyglot-programming.html">polyglots</a>.</li>
	<li>We've woven UX improvement into our sprints. This results in software that's balanced both in terms of user interaction and functionality.</li>
	<li>Test Driven Development: We're yet to get completely infected by this discipline. But we're getting there.</li>
	<li>Not interrupting each other: It takes 15min for people to regain their "flow" if they get interrupted. And if this happens many times in a day, we end up with a stressed out team at the end of each long day. So we prefer patience to instant gratification. [Tip: <a id="nd2." title="Campfire" href="http://campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> is a great tool in this regard. We prefer this to IM].</li>
</ul>
</div>
We'll be blogging about some of the above topics in more detail in the coming weeks. Do drop a line in the comments section below, if you'd like to learn more about anything specifically.
