As mentioned in an <a href="http://www.multunus.com/2010/01/our-pragmatic-processes/">earlier post</a>, our team shares what they learn on a daily basis in our morning stand-ups. Considering our primary focus as a company is lean product development, we felt we could be more aligned with our goals if each of us read books [or blogs] on related subjects. Here's the current list that we've come up with.
