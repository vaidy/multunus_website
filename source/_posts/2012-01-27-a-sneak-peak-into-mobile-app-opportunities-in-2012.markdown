<span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">This was originally supposed to be a post on predictions. But as the founder of a mobile app development company myself, my focus is more on specific opportunities that exist for a boutique company such as ourselves in this space.</span>

<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">We all know that almost no opportunity is exactly what it seems like, but it pays to have good starting points of exploration. And that is what I hope you will leave with, after reading this article.</span></div>
<h2><strong>First let’s look at some <span style="color: #ff0000;">facts</span>:</strong></h2>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
	<li>About 40 per cent of Internet users in India <a href="http://www.medianama.com/2011/03/223-google-india-has-100m-internet-40m-mobile-internet-users-india-search-trends/">access it on their mobile phones</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2011/06/mobile-ize-your-business-with-google.html">61% users are unlikely</a> to return to a site that they found were not mobile optimized. What’s worse, 40% of them are likely to go to a competitor’s website.</li>
	<li>The middle class in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries together have the  <a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/79595/Kaboom-iOS-and-Android-International-Installed-Base-Expansion">largest untapped populations</a> that can now afford a smart phone but are yet to get one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Now take a look at some major <span style="color: #ff0000;">trends</span>:</strong></h2>
<div style="font-weight: bold;">
<ul>
	<li><strong>More Platforms: </strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">We have Apple to thank - for creating the app economy with the iOS platform, Google for democratizing the smart phone with Android and<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/28/windows-phone-marketplace-hits-50-000-app-submission-milestone/"> now Microsoft</a> for making the life of the “I support all platforms” developer more difficult with Windows Phone 7. If you still want to include Blackberry, despite all of the<a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/pressure-mounts-on-blackberrys-rim/story-fnay3ubk-1226223581617"> recent gloom</a>, then that would make it 4 platforms that you’d at least want to consider.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">There are now more a million active apps now available across the major app stores. Apple’s app store and the Android Market currently lead by a large margin. However 2012 will probably bring in at least one more serious contender in the Windows Phone 7 marketplace - it has grown by more than 400% this year alone.</span></div>

<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<h2><strong>Keeping the above in mind, here are a few <span style="color: #ff0000;">opportunities </span>for 2012:</strong></h2>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
	<li><strong>"Hybrid" Cross Platform Apps: </strong>The cross platform tools I've referred to above, allow for native platform API [Application Programming Interface] calls as well. These are useful when you have an application that has a combination of native components and other "content" components which most likely consume web services [and can be built with HTML5 and CSS3].</li>
</ul>
</span></div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<p style="padding-left: 30px;" dir="ltr">An example of such an application is the <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/the-onion-releases-free-html5-ipad-app/">Onion iPad</a> app. The application is written in HTML5 for the most part - but uses falls back on native API to play video. This is probably because of <a href="http://blog.millermedeiros.com/2011/03/html5-video-issues-on-the-ipad-and-how-to-solve-them/">some of the issues</a> related to HTML5 video tag support on iOS. The Onion plans to roll out the app quickly on the Android platform as well - and <a href="http://sndstl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/snd-app.pdf">with mostly the same code</a> [pdf].</p>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"><em>Main Challenges:</em></span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cross Platform Tools are not mature yet: </strong>The API documentation is sparse, support is patchy and the community is still nascent. So which platform should you bet on? Unfortunately, the answer is, "it depends" - on multiple factors such as whether you need a native look and feel (which Appcelerator and Rhodes provide - but PhoneGap does not), the number of platforms you need to support, the technical skills of your dev team etc.</li>
	<li><strong>The Mobile Web is Slow(er):</strong> Performance optimization is key if you want your site to look pretty and be snappy on mobile devices. There are<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=html5+performance+mobile"> many good resources</a> available to get you started in the right direction.</li>
</ul>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"> </span></div>
</span></div>
</div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Low Cost Solutions for Mobile Optimization: </strong>While purely content based sites can choose to rely on the Mobile Optimization Services I've mentioned above, there are a lot of other verticals that don't have such an option - yet. For example, there are a lot of E-Commerce sites out there that are not mobile optimized. Especially those being run by small business owners or startups.</li>
</ul>
</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"><em>Main Challenges:</em></span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul>
	<li>The data has to kept in sync with the original systems - in a seamless fashion</li>
	<li>Mobile payment gateways are still far from mature - <a href="http://www.venturewoods.org/index.php/2011/01/19/mobile-payments-shifting-opportunities-for-startups/">especially in a country like India</a>.</li>
	<li>Oh, and the Mobile Web is Slow - but I said that already.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mobile presence for non-Internet-Savvy retailers: </strong>I'm going on a limb here - but most small retailers in India don't have an Internet presence - and what that means is, a certain  high quality trouser shop with very reasonable price tags - is now invisible on your phone.</li>
</ul>
</span></div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> Main Challenge:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> </em></p>

<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"> </span></div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
	<li>
<ul>
	<li>With even companies like Google<a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-20/internet/29679379_1_google-street-view-google-s-street-view-privacy-concerns"> facing stiff resistance</a> while trying to map our streets, you're left with the only other option - User Generated Content. And that in turn means, the classic chicken and egg conundrum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</span></div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cross Platform Testing as Service: </strong>While there are cloud testing services now available for specific platforms, services that take care of automated cross-platform testing are still not available.</li>
</ul>
</span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"><em> Main Challenge:</em></span></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ul>
	<li>You've got SDK installations, developer &amp; signing certificates, build chains, and custom project layouts to worry about with each platform. <a href="http://savagelook.com/blog/portfolio/8-things-to-know-about-phonegap">PhoneGap solves this problem</a> for you from a deployment perspective, but running automated tests on multiple platforms is a different challenge.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002"> </span></div>
<div><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3345638057217002">This list of opportunities is admittedly short. But I hope you are now motivated to brainstorm more ideas, distill the most interesting opportunities and finally implement a winner in 2012. Happy New Year! </span></div>
