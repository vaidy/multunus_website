	<h1>With Love...</h1>

          Almost everything on this site are our own opinions. But
          we've also been very fortunate to have some nice things
          written about us elsewhere on the Internet. Read on...

	I love our developers. When I say that, I'm not just saying that I love what they do for me. I love them - as coworkers and as people. They're some of the hardest workers that I have ever known and they're pretty fun too. If you don't know the story behind our dev team, allow me to catch you up:

	When I met Gavin and Anil last year, they also introduced me to Multunus - a boutique development shop in Bengaluru, India. They're a relatively small group (<20 people) of developers, data architects and business analysts. They partner with companies like Narrable to build beautiful web apps. It's really like working with your friends - they just happen to live on the other side of the world.

           The experience I had in their office was so cool that I
           guess its not wrong to say that there are lots of inspiring
           things about Multunus. Their people are constant learners,
           so, you can find people up to date on things. I did my bit
           of research before writing this post. I am convinced
           looking at their tweets and their activities online that
           they are constant learners. They love and practice being
           the small "a" agile.

          Their work environment is not the cubicle style and it appeared like a
           joint family sitting together and working. I guess a lot of
           bugs get squashed because people talk to each other face to face.
