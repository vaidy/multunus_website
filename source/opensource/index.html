	<h1>Open Source</h1>
	<p>
          Without Open Source software, our business would perhaps
          have been non-existent. We rely on the hard work and
          generosity of many many individuals and companies - who have
          made their software open source.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've just started on our own journey of giving back to the
          community. But please do come back and visit this page every
          couple of months. You should see some new stuff here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's what we've been up to so far:

	<p><h2>What is it?</h2></p>
	<p>
          We've been struggling to hire good talent for a while now. While this
          is a problem almost every company out there is also facing,
          its even harder for a young company - who've yet to
          establish their brand. Showcasing our on-board talent is a
          nice way to attract people who would otherwise have shied
          away - because of lack of sufficient insight into the
          company.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we created the
          timeline:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.multunus.com/youngturks/"
          target="_new">See the
          demo</a></li> 
            <li><a href="https://github.com/multunus/timeline"
          target="_new">Checkout the Github repo</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're facing a hiring challenge in your company, try
          showcasing your existing talent using this timeline
          tool. And if it works for you too, let us know at
          <a href="mailto:info@multunus.com">info@multunus.com</a>. We'd love to see your timeline and hear
          your story :).
        </p>
	<p><h2>I love this project. How do I contribute?</h2></p>
        <p>
          Thanks! We've put up
          a <a href="https://github.com/multunus/timeline" target="_new">feature backlog on the Github
          page</a>. Fork away!
