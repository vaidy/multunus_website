	<h1>Open Source</h1>
	<p>
          Without Open Source software, our business would perhaps
          have been non-existent. We rely on the hard work and
          generosity of many many individuals and companies - who have
          made their software open source.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've just started on our own journey of giving back to the
          community. But please do come back and visit this page every
          couple of months. You should see some new stuff here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's what we've been up to so far: 
        </p>

	<p><h1 id="timeline">Team Timeline</h1></p>
	<p>
          We've been struggling to hire good talent for a while now. While this
          is a problem almost every company out there is also facing,
          its even harder for a young company - who've yet to
          establish their brand. Showcasing our on-board talent is a
          nice way to attract people who would otherwise have shied
          away - because of lack of sufficient insight into the
          company.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we created the
          timeline:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.multunus.com/youngturks/"
          target="_new">See the
          demo</a></li> 
            <li><a href="https://github.com/multunus/timeline"
          target="_new">Checkout the Github repo</a></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're facing a hiring challenge in your company, try
          showcasing your existing talent using this timeline
          tool. And if it works for you too, let us know at
          <a href="mailto:info@multunus.com">info@multunus.com</a>. We'd love to see your timeline and hear
          your story :).

        <p>
          This website is built using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki" target="_new">Jekyll</a> - a static site generator
          that is blog aware. We used to be on Wordpress - but that’s
          another story.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re new to Jekyll, but are into Ruby and are looking
          for a solution for building a flexible, maintainable and
          fast site - do checkout Jekyll.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you’re already a Jekyll fan, you know that there’s a
          <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins" target="_new">whole bunch of awesome plugins</a> out there to help you build
          your site. The one thing that we could however not find was
          something to filter our blog posts by Author.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that is exactly what this project is about. Simple
          enough - but useful. :)

              applying this plugin
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/multunus/jekyll-author-plugin" target="">Checkout the Github Repo</a> (instructions are within the ReadMe)
