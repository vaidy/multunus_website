  <p>It was our job to upgrade the system from Version 1 to Version 2 – along with the migration of the already signed up radio stations to the new version. Further, we’re also responsible for adding new customers to the new version.</p>

  <p>Many of the Extreme Programming practices were applied on this project – including Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and Exploratory Testing.</p>

  <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Ruby on Rails, Cucumber, RSpec, Selenium</p>
