<p>We’ve successfully applied the offshore-onshore model to help many startups go from an idea to full products. All of these products were built with an agile “mindset” of collaboration and communication. </p>

<p>At this point, we’re working in a lean startup model - that encourages a lot more experimentation and validation of assumptions - while rapidly releasing new version of the product every week.</p>
