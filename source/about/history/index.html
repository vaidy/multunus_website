	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>
		Multunus started its operations from scratch in April ‘08. Our goal was to build a top quality, high integrity, customer focused and a very employee friendly organization. Our progress since then:
		<ul>
			<li>The team has grown to 18 full time people. We expect to reach 25 by March 2013.</li>
			<li>Built more than 10 products for clients across multiple domains.</li>
			<li>Conceived and built our own first product – UserThoughts [Currently in Alpha].</li>
			<li>Transformed our entire process to upgrade to Extreme Programming across all projects.</li>
			<li>Silver Sponsored RubyConfIndia 2011.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is the following things that have really helped us get to where we are today:
		<ul>
			<li>We have some of the most committed and passionate individuals on our team.</li>
			<li>A very strong faith in our ability as a team to deliver real value for our customers.</li>
			<li>A strong focus on continuous improvement – both in terms of our knowledge and our skills</li>
			<li>The fact that we really enjoy what we do here at Multunus</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	We’re now at a point of inflection that will allow us to tap into our potential and deliver a lot more value in 2012.
