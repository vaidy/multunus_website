Multunus started its operations from scratch in April ‘08. Our goal was to build a top quality, high integrity, customer focused and a very employee friendly organization. Our progress since then:

The team has grown to 18 full time people. We expect to reach 25 by March 2013.
Built more than 10 products for clients across multiple domains.
Conceived and built our own first product – UserThoughts [Currently in Alpha].
Transformed our entire process to upgrade to Extreme Programming across all projects.
Silver Sponsored RubyConfIndia 2011.
It is the following things that have really helped us get to where we are today:

We have some of the most committed and passionate individuals on our team.
A very strong faith in our ability as a team to deliver real value for our customers.
A strong focus on continuous improvement – both in terms of our knowledge and our skills
The fact that we really enjoy what we do here at Multunus
We’re now at a point of inflection that will allow us to tap into our potential and deliver a lot more value in 2012.
