	<h1>Careers</h1>
	<p>You&#8217;ve come to the right plac if you&#8217;re looking for a workplace that invests deeply in the professional growth of its employees. Here&#8217;s a few ways that we do that:
	<ul>
	<li>We&#8217;ve implemented our own version of the 20% time that Google is famous for. You get to spend 45 minutes everyday learning and interacting with your colleagues.</li>
	<li>We ask everyone to leave by 7PM everyday. And working weekends are strongly discouraged.</li>
	<li>We constantly invest in some of the best training material available</li>
	<li>We invite industry leaders to visit our office and interact with the team here. We call these events &#8220;fireside chats&#8221;</li>
	<li>We have lunch together on Wednesdays &#8211; so that all of us get an hour to discuss anything that&#8217;s we want to</li>
	<li>We conduct hacknights</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>We also take everyone out to lunch and dinner every couple of months. We do  team trips to interesting places. We&#8217;ve got a fully stocked snack bar within the office &#8216;coz hungry employees are no fun to work with. And we celebrate birthday&#8217;s and anniversaries &#8211; and anything else, that calls for a celebration :).</p>

		<p>If your question is not answered below or you’re impatient, feel free to reach out to us using the contact information given above.</p>

		<p><a href="#id1">Q: What do you look for in candidates for your developer positions?</a><br />
	<a href="#id2">Q: How many rounds of interviews do you have?</a><br />
	<a href="#id3">Q: What are the steps in the hiring process?</a><br />
	<a href="#id4">Q: What languages am I allowed to use for the programming rounds?</a><br />

	<a href="#id7">Q: I will need to travel a long way to Bangalore to attend the in-person round. Will you re-imburse the cost of my travel?</a></p>

		<p><strong id="id1">Q: What do you look for in candidates for your developer positions?</strong><br />
	A love for programming and a great attitude are the fundamental requirements. For details, please check the <a href="#open_positions">Open Positions</a> section above.</p>

		<p><strong id="id2">Q: How many rounds of interviews do you have?</strong><br />
	Usually 4-5 rounds. But the interview process is agile in nature. What this means, is that we’ll have as many rounds as is required for us to make our decision. Generally though, 3-4 of our colleagues will interact with you – over phone calls, in-person conversations and a pair-programming assignment</p>

		<p><strong id="id3">Q: What are the steps in the hiring process?</strong><br />
	If you are looking for a <strong>programmer position</strong>, <a href="http://puzzle.multunus.com">solve our online puzzle</a> and submit your solution to get started. You can find the instructions on the puzzle site. If we like your profile, one of our senior engineers will reach out to you by email or a phone call. Depending on the situation, we’ll either invite you over for a test at our office premises in Bangalore or have a preliminary discussion with you on phone. Assuming that step goes well, we’ll follow up with the next rounds quickly and if possible, try and complete the entire process in a day’s time.</p>

		<p> If you're looking for a <strong>Business Analyst position</strong>, please write to us at <a href="mailto:info@multunus.com">info@multunus.com</a> with answers to the following questions: 
			<ul>
				<li>Why would you like to play the role of a BA?</li>
				<li>Why would you like to work for Multunus?</li>
				<li>What do you think is the role of a BA in an Extreme Programming team?</li>
			</ul>
			If you're shortlisted (based on the answers you send in), you'll receive a reponse from our team.
		</p>



		<p><strong id="id4">Q: What languages am I allowed to use for the programming rounds?</strong><br />
	We’re mostly language and platform agnostic in our approach to problem solving, at Multunus. Hence you get to pick the platform of your choice and we’ll set up a development environment according to your taste.</p>

		<p><strong id="id5">Q: Will the in-person interview take a lot of time?</strong><br />
	Yes, please plan to spend 4-6 hours at our office on the day you’re invited to come over.</p>

		<p><strong id="id6">Q: I’ll probably not be able to come down to Bangalore for the in-person rounds. Can these be conducted remotely?</strong><br />
	If you cannot make it in person for some reason, we’ll try and conduct these “personal” rounds via a Skype video call. But that would be an exception, rather than the rule.</p>

		<p><strong id="id7">Q: I will need to travel a long way to Bangalore to attend the in-person round. Will you re-imburse the cost of my travel?</strong><br />
	Yes, sometimes we do. If you’d like us to re-imburse your travel expenses, please make sure to check with us first before planning your travel. Based on the specific situation, we’ll make a decision and let you know.</p>
