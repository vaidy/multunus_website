            If you&#8217;re familiar with Extreme Programming, then we&#8217;re happy tell you that we&#8217;re one among very few companies practicing XP. And we&#8217;re proud of that.
            <br /><br/><br />
            If you haven&#8217;t heard of XP, but are looking to work with an agile team, then we&#8217;re still on the same page. We prefer to think of XP as the most &#8220;complete&#8221;. But we&#8217;re not the only ones.
            <br /><br/>

            <br />
            &#8220; None of the other Agile methods are as well defined, or as broad in scope as XP.
            <br />
            &#8230;.
            <br />
            &#8230;.
            <br />
            Of all the Agile methods, XP is the only method that provides deep and profound disciplines for the way developers do their daily work. Of those disciplines, Test Driven Development is the most revolutionary and impactful. &#8220;
